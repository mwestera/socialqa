This story describes the aftermath of my leaving an untenable position  
  
I quit my job, flipped my LinkedIn status to 'willing to hear from recruiters' flew home and spent a few days catching up with house/motorcycle/dental/car repairs, cat feeding and sleeping on a sopophoric couch.  
  
I log back into LinkedIn to nothing I can take- temp to perm jobs three states away, sales positions and ill-formed "do everything like a senior but pay you like an intern" positions.   
  
I even think about picking up some litigation work, but that smells like failure.  
  
I drop a line to two technical recruiters I like and ask for some contract work to tide me over.  
  
One, who we'll call Burt, calls me back that afternoon.  
  
Burt:"Hey, I saw you were looking for short term work. I have an, er, odd request and you might be interested"    
  
I hear a buzzing sound in the background, but assume it's just noise on the line.
  
  
Burt:"This isn't one of my normal clients. They need to figure out their backups and possibly recover some data. It's urgent, so the faster you can get here, the faster you'll get paid. I'll guarantee that part if you make them happy"  
  
I get a contact, an address and a phone number. I tell Burt I'll be there this afternoon and make my self presentable, collect some tools, then ride out there on my motorcycle.  
  
I arrive, find a place to park and busy my self with getting my suit jacket and laptop bag off the bike while securing my motorcycle gear in my saddlebags.  
  
A middle aged woman has left her beige sedan and is walking towards me with a "I want to talk to your manager" air.  
  
Beige Camry:"Don't you know you'll never amount to anything riding that death machine?"  
  
I'm still fumbling with my remove sunglasses, pull regular glasses from their case, place sunglasses in case, remove helmet, put glasses on my face without dropping anything or poking myself in the eye with the glasses, so I don't pay Beige Camry much attention.  
  
  
Beige Camry:"You won't go to college and you won't make it past 30 doing stupid things"  
  
I'm now paying attention. I'm still confused. I look around to make sure she's addressing me. She is. She's planted her nurse shoe wearing feet and wants to give me both barrels.  
  
me:"I've made it past 30 and graduated college, but I still do stupid things. Thank you for the compliment"  
  
I go back to the stowing and bungee cording while she glares, then walks off, towards a building next to the parking lot.  
  
A few minutes later, I'm respectably wearing a suit jacket with my laptop bag slung over my shoulder looking for my destination.   
  
I find my destination and the appropriate office suite. It turns out to be the Law Offices of Amygdala and Euripides, PC . The receptionist tells me to wait in a waiting room with outdated magazines while I hear the buzz of drills.  
  
A middle aged man introduces himself as Mr Euripides and ushers me back to his cramped office.  
  
Me:"So, I understand you have some problems with backups"  
  
Euripides:"We do. We switched providers and now everything is messed up."  
  
Me:"Ok. By 'service', we're talking a managed service provider- a contractor who handles technical issues, sets up systems and the like'?  
  
Euripides:"Yes. The old one was too expensive. They were charging us rent on a file server, so we terminated the contract. I had my nephew build a new server and connect it to a cheaper backup service"  
  
  
Euripides:" About two weeks ago, we lost all our files on the server and neither of the backups work. Each blames the other and they start talking technobabble. I threatened them with litigation, but that didn't get my files back." 
  
Me:"I think I understand. I speak fluent technobabble. Let me take a look and I'll give you an estimate on the costs"  
  
Euripides:"Burt is taking care of that part"  
  
I'll have to figure out what that means. I'm here, so I should at least take a look. Lawyer hands me a wrinkled sheet of paper and walks me to a louder room. It seems that their IT closet is in a construction zone. There's sheet rock dust, saw dust and a few broken drop-ceiling tiles' worth of detritus on a single open rack.  
  
At the bottom of the rack are two flashy gaming PC towers. Translucent Lucite sides with LED light strips show me a stack of hard drives . Clearly the builder was thinking about a different kind of Enterprise than I was.  
  
I turn to Euripides. 
  
  
Lawyer:"My nephew's number is on that paper. I don't understand all this stuff anyway. Anything else you need from me?"  
  
me:"Let me take a look and I'll call your nephew if I have any questions"  
  
He walks off while I grab a spare keyboard and monitor from an unused cubicle. I plug into the PC on the left and use a password on the sheet to login.  
  
A bit of poking and the OS sees one mountable volume, but four drives. Seems they're some kind of RAID. One drive is showing a hardware failure.  
  
That's odd, but perhaps that's because Windows isn't my strength. I reboot the first PC from a linux USB drive and move my monitor and keyboard to number 2.  
  
This one is a bit happier. I see two volumes mounted. One for the OS, one for file storage.  
  
  
This might be easier than I thought.  
  
I look through the backups and see one per day, going back about a month or two.  
  
I pick one from about two weeks ago. It's compressed, so it's going to take a few minutes. I swap back to the first PC, which has booted linux.  
  
Ok. Four drives. I can mount the OS drive fine. One dead. Remaining two a part of an array. I don't get it. Assuming RAID 5, one drive can fail and we can still read and write data. I need to think on this for a second.  
  
Back to the other PC to see how the restore's coming. That was fast. I open the folder and see a full backup.  
  
Of the operating system. Not the file storage. I check the other backups and they're all the same size. Great.   
  
Then I notice something that makes me sad. The OS volume is 4TB. The Storage volume is 12TB. One drive, three drives.   
  
There's no parity, the drives aren't mirrored. If any one fails, the whole volume fails.   
  
I find Lawyer's nephew's number and call it. I get voicemail. I tell him to call me back.  
  
So my local backups aren't and the one volume that holds the data is borked.  
  
This is going to be complicated. I call Bart, the recruiter who brought me in.  
  
  
me:"Uh, not so well. I have a feeling this is going to be expensive."  
  
  
me:"We might have to ship out three drives for recovery. We're talking a few thousand to start"  
  
  
me:"I don't have a clean room. I might swap a hard drive controller board, but this is magic by comparison."  
  
  
me:"I have one last thing to try, but I'm not feeling lucky. Give me an hour"  
  
  
  
Bart:"Yep. I'll pay you for your time and barter with Euripides"  
  
  
I look at the other number on the paper. It's a local MSP named OnFight. I call the number. After a few minutes in a phone tree inspired by the maze in Zork 1, I exit the twisty passages and get to Joel, a support rep.  
  
Joel:"HithisisJoelatOnFightpleasehold"  
  
  
hold music, occasionally interrupted by short, amateur commercials about how _awesome_ OnFight's service is.  
  
Joel:"HithisisJoelthankyouforwaiting. What'sthecustomernumber?"  
  
me:"I'm trying to reach whomever manages your backups. I don't have a customer number, but the customer is Law Offices of Amygdala and Euripides, PC."  
  
  
me:"Wait wait wait. Can I talk to a manager for five minutes? I think can solve a problem for you all if I can talk to someone who can make a quick decision"  
  
  
The wait isn't as long.  
  
Manager:"Hi there. This is Rebecca. What's this about Amygdala and Euripides?"  
  
me:"Thanks. You used to rent them a server and do their backups, right?"  
  
Rebecca:"That's correct. A few months ago we got told to take the server back and to stop the backups"  
  
me:"Ok, got that. Is there any chance you haven't wiped that server?"  
  
Rebecca:"We overwrote the drive,  reformatted the server and allocated it to a new customer. Backups securely overwritten per A&E's request"  
  
  
Rebecca:"That's correct. We have emails from Euripides' nephew and a signed letter from Euripides himself"  
  
  
I call Nephew again.  
  
  
me:"Hi. This is Lawtechie. I'm trying to figure out your backups"  
  
  
me:"Let me understand. The shiny box on the left is the primary and the one on the right is the backup?"  
  
  
me:"It looks like you're only backing up the C: drive"  
  
  
me:"You're backing up the operating system on a nightly basis"  
  
  
me:"No, that's reinstallable. What about the various documents your uncle's law practice actually runs on?"  
  
  
  
  
me:"There's a lesson every techie learns. If you don't test your backups, you don't have any"  
  
Nephew:"We shouldn't need them. Those disks are RAID"  
  
me:"You sure? It looks like you set them up without mirrors or parity"  
  
  
me:"I think you should learn some things before building systems that people rely on next time"  
  
Nephew:"Yeah. I'm going into cybersecurity soon so that stuff won't matter"  
  
me:"Good for you. That's a business where charlatans and the soulless run rampant. There's also a negative side."  
  
  
me:"Is there any chance there's a full backup anywhere else somewhere?"  
  
  
me:"Tried that. Seems that you told them to burn it all"  
  
  
me:"I wish you luck in your career"  
  
  
I texted Bart to tell him that it wasn't looking good, then I walked to Euripides' office to tell him about hard drive recovery. He thanked me in the way people do when they think you're trying to take advantage of them and said that he'd talk to his nephew before making any important decisions.  
  
Bart paid me for that day and I went home.</td><td>A lot of times, it isn't *actual* upper-middle-class people, but *wannabe* upper-middle-class people, a.k.a. karens, who inhabit HOA boards.

The administration finds itself in a tough position, as the Taliban has made it clear that it will not accept a troop presence beyond 8/31, but US allies don't want to commit to that date. It's not clear if everyone that the US and other G-7 countries want out can get out in that time, or what will happen if they don't.
I find the foreign policy optics of this interesting, given Biden's campaign promises to restore US relations with our allies and the reputation of the Trump administration as acting alone without consulting them.

Hi all. I recently setup a VPN on my local network for remote access and have been playing close attention to my logs for the meantime to make sure I'm not seeing any suspicious behavior. Well.. unfortunately I *have* been seeing exactly that today, but curiously it seems entirely isolated from my VPN. I'll explain, as I'd love some thoughts..
To preface, I'm working with a relatively cheap Netgear router. No DMZ feature is enabled. UPnP is enabled, with the sole entry being my Plex server. As of yesterday, there's a single port forwarding entry, pointing towards my VPN from an obscure port.
I noticed today that I was seeing dozens of log entries in my router marked 'LAN access from remote', all forwarding a ton of different IP addresses directly toward my laptop I was actively working on, all with a different port.
My first hunch was that something I was running, Zoom or something, was connecting to external servers with UPnP, but I couldn't see any new UPnP listings in my router. Additionally, I ran \`whois\` against the IP addresses and they returned some rather suspect listings originating from all over the world. Also, I don't imagine I'd see *quite* such a spread of ports.
Ultimately, I temporarily disabled UPnP and that seemed to stop the behavior for now.
I'm very confused here and not quite sure if I should be concerned. *How* could these remote IPs been forwarded to my laptop when my port forwarding explicitly targets my VPN, a separate device. Is it significant that disabling UPnP stopped this? There's absolutely nothing configured to point towards my laptop. Could something malicious on my laptop have opened ports with UPnP? Again, I saw no UPnP entries either in my logs or registered to forward.
I suspect there might be an issue with my router that's not protecting my network as it should? For instance, I see two adjacent log entries from the same public source IP. The first registers as a DoS attack and suggested port scan, and the following entry shows the same source address being forwarded to my laptop.
If anyone has any ideas, I'm all ears, as this is a little worrying. I'm wondering if I should close my ports off for now? Although, I'm not sure that would help, given that those are pointing to a different IP anyway.
**Edit**: Looks like this is happening again, and I can confirm via Wireshark that the messages are in fact getting to my laptop.
**Update (9/1):** This just keeps getting stranger. I've since disconnected the laptop in question from my network, and I can still see my router attempting to forward traffic to it, even without any trace of that IP in the network settings. I'm currently wondering if my router is exhibiting some buggy behavior where it's assigned this laptop as the DMZ.
I re-enabled UPnP this morning and began to see the intrusions again. This time, it began recently enough that I was able to see how it started.
If you look at the logs you can see my laptop trigger 'AddPortMapping' and 'DeletePortMapping' events in quick succession, and plenty of port scanning begin almost immediately afterwards. I assume that this UPnP behavior is an exploit to persist the port mappings while erasing any trace of them from my router's interface. Scary stuff.
I've understood the concerns with UPnP until now, but holy shit.. I've obviously disabled UPnP for now and am trying to track down the source of these UPnP events in my network. I'm wondering if there's any likelihood that a device apart from my laptop is spoofing its source IP..
Has anyone seen this sort of thing before?
**Update (12/5):** For anyone who might be interested, I wrote a blog post documenting some of my findings here. TLDR: disable UPnP on your router..</td><td>You shouldn't set yourself on fire to keep your mother warm.

OK, so I am not sure whether this is an "Entitled people" or an "I don't work here lady post". Probably a bit of both really.
Happened yesterday as I was filling my ute (pickup truck for the USA types) at the service station. I had been out working my bees so I was dirty, sweaty and tired. I had an old stained T shirt on, shorts and thongs (flip flops). I in no way looked like I worked there.
A young twenties something woman (hereafter Karen because, hey why not) pulls up to the other side of my fuel pump. She was dressed in sharp business style complete with the high heels and false nails.
Karen: "Fill my tank when you are done there". As she starts to walk inside the store.
Karen: "Ugh! I don't care! just fill the damn car!" A then she storms off inside with a clatter of high heels.
I just shrug, finish filling my tank and head inside to pay. I have no fucks left to give these days. It might have been different if there had been some common courtesy used, a "please" or "thank you" or "a could you possibly help me" but brusque orders are the absolute best way to piss this old guy off.
I head to the counter and see Karen is already waiting there to one side.
The guy behind the register looks surprised.
Cashier: "There is only the one sale for number four pump".
Karen instantly goes from zero to uzi, red faced and shouting because apparently I had defied her command. "I told you to fill the fucking tank! Jesus christ are you fucking stupid" and so on.
Me: "Look bitch, I don't work here, I don't work for you and I most certainly don't take orders from arrogant cunts so get out there and pump your own fucking fuel".
She ranted some more, I left, too tired, don't care.
So I am still trying to work out exactly what her problem was. I have never encountered this level of self centered arrogance before. If anyone has any ideas I would like to hear them.

I look through the backups and see one per day, going back about a month or two.  
  
I pick one from about two weeks ago. It's compressed, so it's going to take a few minutes. I swap back to the first PC, which has booted linux.  
  
Ok. Four drives. I can mount the OS drive fine. One dead. Remaining two a part of an array. I don't get it. Assuming RAID 5, one drive can fail and we can still read and write data. I need to think on this for a second.  
  
Back to the other PC to see how the restore's coming. That was fast. I open the folder and see a full backup.  
  
Of the operating system. Not the file storage. I check the other backups and they're all the same size. Great.   
  
Then I notice something that makes me sad. The OS volume is 4TB. The Storage volume is 12TB. One drive, three drives.   
  
There's no parity, the drives aren't mirrored. If any one fails, the whole volume fails.   
  
I find Lawyer's nephew's number and call it. I get voicemail. I tell him to call me back.  
  
So my local backups aren't and the one volume that holds the data is borked.  
  
This is going to be complicated. I call Bart, the recruiter who brought me in.  
  
  
me:"Uh, not so well. I have a feeling this is going to be expensive."  
  
  
me:"We might have to ship out three drives for recovery. We're talking a few thousand to start"  
  
  
me:"I don't have a clean room. I might swap a hard drive controller board, but this is magic by comparison."  
  
  
me:"I have one last thing to try, but I'm not feeling lucky. Give me an hour"  
  
  
  
Bart:"Yep. I'll pay you for your time and barter with Euripides"  
  
  
I look at the other number on the paper. It's a local MSP named OnFight. I call the number. After a few minutes in a phone tree inspired by the maze in Zork 1, I exit the twisty passages and get to Joel, a support rep.  
  
Joel:"HithisisJoelatOnFightpleasehold"  
  
  
hold music, occasionally interrupted by short, amateur commercials about how _awesome_ OnFight's service is.  
  
Joel:"HithisisJoelthankyouforwaiting. What'sthecustomernumber?"  
  
me:"I'm trying to reach whomever manages your backups. I don't have a customer number, but the customer is Law Offices of Amygdala and Euripides, PC."  
  
  
me:"Wait wait wait. Can I talk to a manager for five minutes? I think can solve a problem for you all if I can talk to someone who can make a quick decision"  
  
  
The wait isn't as long.  
  
Manager:"Hi there. This is Rebecca. What's this about Amygdala and Euripides?"  
  
me:"Thanks. You used to rent them a server and do their backups, right?"  
  
Rebecca:"That's correct. A few months ago we got told to take the server back and to stop the backups"  
  
me:"Ok, got that. Is there any chance you haven't wiped that server?"  
  
Rebecca:"We overwrote the drive,  reformatted the server and allocated it to a new customer. Backups securely overwritten per A&E's request"  
  
  
Rebecca:"That's correct. We have emails from Euripides' nephew and a signed letter from Euripides himself"  
  
  
I call Nephew again.  
  
  
me:"Hi. This is Lawtechie. I'm trying to figure out your backups"  
  
  
me:"Let me understand. The shiny box on the left is the primary and the one on the right is the backup?"  
  
  
me:"It looks like you're only backing up the C: drive"  
  
  
me:"You're backing up the operating system on a nightly basis"  
  
  
me:"No, that's reinstallable. What about the various documents your uncle's law practice actually runs on?"  
  
  
  
  
me:"There's a lesson every techie learns. If you don't test your backups, you don't have any"  
  
Nephew:"We shouldn't need them. Those disks are RAID"  
  
me:"You sure? It looks like you set them up without mirrors or parity"  
  
  
me:"I think you should learn some things before building systems that people rely on next time"  
  
Nephew:"Yeah. I'm going into cybersecurity soon so that stuff won't matter"  
  
me:"Good for you. That's a business where charlatans and the soulless run rampant. There's also a negative side."  
  
  
me:"Is there any chance there's a full backup anywhere else somewhere?"  
  
  
me:"Tried that. Seems that you told them to burn it all"  
  
  
me:"I wish you luck in your career"  
  
  
I texted Bart to tell him that it wasn't looking good, then I walked to Euripides' office to tell him about hard drive recovery. He thanked me in the way people do when they think you're trying to take advantage of them and said that he'd talk to his nephew before making any important decisions.  
  
Bart paid me for that day and I went home.</td><td>My old boss did something like that a couple years ago. Made some changes on a switch to enable a new IP camera system we were installing, but got some things jacked up, so he rebooted the switch. Unfortunately, there were a bunch of other important configuration elements which had been made previously, but *never copied to the boot configuration*. So when the switch came back up, it was missing a bunch of things that were pretty much mission critical for that section of the plant.
He eventually got it reconfigured to the working setup and then got the IP cameras added successfully, but it took him a couple of days to get it all worked out. Somehow, in all that time since the previous configuration changes had been made, the switch had never gone down, so he had forgotten that the running config had never been saved to the startup config.</td><td>0.6327065321345375</td><td>0.0600966963839906</td><td>0</td></tr>

My old college roommate didn't know how to cook or do dishes and didn't go food shopping much. This led to him eating my food, especially my leftovers as those were prepared meals. I would use my leftovers to meal prep for the week, and told him to stop as it was expensive as well as inconvenient. The behavior did not stop and he actually seemed to be eating more of my food out of spite. To punish him, I baked a chocolate cake with habanero peppers and mixed the frosting with wasabi. I labled it with my name and a bold "Do Not Eat" and waited. This guy has a very low tolerance for spicy foods so I thought he would take one bite quickly realize the error of his ways. About two days later, him and a couple of his friends got really drunk while I was at work and decided to dig into my food. Somehow, they ate about a third of it before realizing, and when they inevitable went to throw up from over drinking and eating spicy foods, got hit by the cake a 2nd time.

This article is **completely wrong** and relies on a misreading of the data that I wouldn't expect even a middle schooler to make.
> But this data is misleading because the most recent data shows that only .9% of deaths related to the coronavirus are related to individuals with no comorbidity (i.e. pre-existing conditions)
> Therefore based on this data, only 150 Americans have died from the coronavirus who had no pre-existing conditions out of 16,697. 
**No**. Bad Gateway Pundit. This is the worst kind of fake news, and you can see why in bold text in the screenshot in the article.
> Death Rate = (number of deaths / number of cases) = probability of dying if infected by the virus (%). This probability differs depending on pre-existing condition. The percentage shown below does **NOT represent in any way the share of deaths by pre-existing condition. Rather, it represents, for a patient with a given pre-existing condition, the risk of dying if infected by COVID-19.**
The Gateway Pundit reads the data exactly backwards, in direct contradiction to the bold text. It's not that 0.9% of people who died had none of these conditions. It's that 0.9% of people who caught the virus and had none of these conditions have died. 
We can dig further into this data. The comorbidity table shown in the article comes from Chinese data here. In China, people with no other conditions represented 13% of all deaths. If we assume that the demographics in the US are the same and that China's data is accurate (both of these assumptions are suspect) that would imply that the actual number of dead Americans to date with no other conditions would be **2,300**, not 150.
Furthermore, even if these numbers were right, is the conclusion that these lives are expendable? 68 million Americans, or 1/3 of adults, have hypertension alone. Do we not care about them?</td><td>0.6327066694552732</td><td>0.0217412191411934</td><td>0</td></tr>

The story is about a man who wants to cook some food on his stove, when he comes home in the evening after a full day of work.  In his dark hut, he uses his only source of light, a paraffin lantern, to try to locate his matches to start the fire.  He looks in his closest, opening the doors and peering inside, the lantern lighting the way.  But they are not there.
He goes to the firewood box, and opens it, using the lantern to light the innards - but the matches are not inside.
The shadows of the logs flicker on the wall as he does so.
He goes outside to the latrine - perhaps he left the matches there when he smoked his pipe yesterday?  But alas, they are not there either.
Ripples and small waves shimmer in the light of the lantern, as the pale of water is moved about to search for the small sticks.
He looks in his drawers, his coat, his cloak and all the boxes or pouches he can find in his dark hut - using the lantern to light the way.
But the matches are no where to be found.
Hungry, frustrated and tired the man goes to sleep ready for his early start and long hours tomorrow at work.
It's a semi-Buddhist tale, equivalent to "can't see the forest for the trees".
If he stopped and thought about it, his candlelight - the lantern - could have been used to start the stove.  If he knew the candlelight was fire, the meal would have been cooked much earlier in the day, and he would have been satisfied when he slept, and been fresh for work tomorrow.
If you immediately know the candlelight is fire, then the meal was cooked a long time ago.

Winston Groom was paid $350,000 for the screenplay rights to his novel Forrest Gump and was contracted for a 3 percent share of the film's net profits. However, Paramount and the film's producers did not pay him, using Hollywood accounting to posit that the blockbuster film lost money. Tom Hanks, by contrast, contracted for a percent share of the film's gross receipts instead of a salary, and he and director Zemeckis each received $40 million. Additionally, Groom was not mentioned once in any of the film's six Oscar-winner speeches.
>Groom's dispute with Paramount was later effectively resolved after Groom declared he was satisfied with Paramount's explanation of their accounting, this coinciding with Groom receiving a seven-figure contract with Paramount for film rights to another of his books, Gump & Co.

>UPDATE! We've recently received an email from author Winston Groom, who asserts that the rumors of a feud between he and Paramount are completely false. He says, "There was never any "feud" between me and Paramount Pictures that caused any delay in making a movie of Gump & Company, a sequel to Forrest Gump. Hell, the studio bought the sequel a paid me a ton of dough even before it came out, and they then owned it, as they still do, and can make it a movie anytime they damn well please."</td><td>Maybe don't steal, then.

Sorry, this will take a while.
For Background:
Me (27M) and my Family are from Russia but moved to Germany when I was 8, and my parents have a lot of russian friends here, so we still have a lot of contact to russians. One friend of our family owns a pretty good russian restaurant. It's pretty big and well visited and on weekends there are even live musicians and a lot of dancing and so on. It's very nice and 200 people on a saturday is pretty normal for them. He called my mom once and asked if my sister (18 at the time) wanted to be waitress for this evening and earn a bit money. My sister was happy and said yes. But she had no car/license at the time and the restaurant was like 55km away, and my parents were out on that day, so my dad asked me if I would get her there and bring her back. I had no plans so I said yes, but since I dont wanted to bring her there and leave to come back 2-3 hours later to get her I decided to wait there. The restaurant is pretty classy, so it's pretty normal for guests to go there with their best clothes on. I didnt want to look weird so I put on my suit and bring her there. So, thats the background. Sorry for this long intro!
now to the main story: It was pretty full at this evening (250+guests i guess) and the Staff had a lot of work. Even the friend, who is the manager makes service and works nonstop. It's loud but very entertaining. As said, the staff was very busy and I didn't want to stand in their way so I stood aside and just enjoyed the music. The musicians do breaks sometimes and one of them, lets call him Alex, had a few minutes break and came to me for a little chat (it's super loud so we talk like in a club: how's work? what's new? had any dates lately?- stuff like that) There was a little couch we sat down as shared memes on the phones to each other and relaxing a bit. Suddenly, i feel a finger on my shoulder. Entering Karen... A woman in her 50s (blue fancy dress,  pearl necklace , a ton of make up and the typical Karen-haircut ) pointed at me and waved so I stand up and talk to her. Me: "Yea?" Karen: "Wow, if I would work like YOU do here, i shouldnt wonder to get fired. You just sit there and don't serve the food like the others!" I was shocked. The staff wears red vests with the restaurants name on the back and I was there in my usual black suit. "Sorry, what? I don't work h.." I got interrupted mid-sentence because Karen, took her flat hand and put it in my face and turned away moaning: "Don't you dare contradict me, streetdog! ( in russian there is a word for that, which is hard to translate but it means like "filthy, norights-creature" It's a very rude word) Me: "THE F?" She wents off to the bath rooms. Alex, who has seen it allm took my arm and said: "dude, the F? relax, lets go outside and take a smoke. You look like you'd explode any second!" Yes, I wanted to run after her and tell her a few things but I went outside and calmed down a bit. The manager came out and took a smokebreak too and asked me what's up. Alex told him the story and the Manager went crazy about it. HE apologized for a guests behavior. Now the surprise: A Guy standing outside nearby must have heard that and came right over: Guy:" The woman you are talking about: does she wear blue fancy dress, pearls etc.?" we:"yes" Guy looked pretty embarrassed. "That's my wife" We were all shocked. The Guy then apologized for his wife. He was completely ashamed. And went back in. We all started laughing. I enjoyed the rest of the music-acts and 2 hours later my sister and me went home. Still a funny story, when I think of the poor guy married to russian Karen.
Sorry for this insanely long story, but I hope you enjoyed it :) Have a nice day all :)</td><td>Engine drives an alternator, which produces AC.

(Dallas, TX) </td><td>If you are a solo slooper or even duos here are a few tips that you want engrained into you so its muscle memory.
1. As soon as you start and wake up, check the reapers board to see how many ships are flying the reapers emissary. Although it doesn't mean potential combatants, its still good to see what folks are reaping on the server. 3 or more I'd just jump to a different server. periodically check your ships map board since you can see reapers and their locations if you are running as an emissary. 
2. After you drop your anchor when you approach your destination, raise your sails then raise your anchor. Once you get better with the ships mechanics and handling, you'll be able to just raise your sails and nail your landings without touching the "brakes/anchor". Also when parking your ship on islands, choose to park it in lagoons, or on the side of the island that provides concealment, this way other ships won't see your mast if they are looking out for ships. If the island is closer to the edge of the map, park your ship on the side that's closer to the edge since less ships use those waters to travel.
3. Before you disembark, do a 360 scan of your surroundings. go up in the crows nest and see what ships are in your "area of operation". If you are going underwater for shipwrecks or lost shipments, constantly rescan your horizon whenever you come back up, a ship anchored in the middle of the open ocean is an easy target to spot.
4. If you are trying to run away, always head directly into the wind and make sure your sails are facing the wind dead on as if the wind in reality would be pushing you in reverse. Sloops can out run all other ship types when sailing into the wind with their sails in this option.
5. If you are on Xbox, or use a controller, set hot keys for your bucket, throwables, and cannon ball types. Right on the D pad for me is my bucket, Up is throwables, and Left is cannon balls. This will save you.</td><td>0.6327193680543314</td><td>-0.0570343452966355</td><td>0</td></tr>

I once bought a JAZ drive in an external SCSI enclosure. Don't know JAZ? Think of a harddisk/floppy hybrid with the - back then - generous space of one gigabyte. And the price was ... generous ..., too.
After a short while, the drive got issues. Severe issues as in data loss. So I sent the drive + enclosure as I had bought it back to the seller (usually a very reliable shop). They sent in the JAZ drive for testing, and it came back as "no issues found", so I got the device back, together with the invoice from IOMEGA (the drive manufacturer) for an unnecessary test.
Sadly, it still didn't work. But a friend of mine got shocked when touching the metal case of the enclosure. He was our electronics guy and went digging. Turned out that the enclosures' PSU had grounding issues and put the case on 110V.
Armed with this information, I called the shop again. Of course, they had sent in the bare drive to IOMEGA, and never tested the enclosure as such. So I sent all of it back in, got it back with a brand new enclosure, and they took the invoice for the test back.</td><td>You telling him about an incident is one thing, but playing the recorded proof is quite another.

This is a critical point. I believe that it was Mr. Pink in Reservoir Dogs that said: "I assume that the price of the meal includes getting it to the table."
I take the position that if all a server does is drop off the food at my table and I do not see them again then they really haven't earned a tip.
edit. I misremembered. Though I do fell that the price of a meal should include getting it to the table, follows is the actual missive by Mr. Pink against tipping:
Nice Guy Eddie: You don't tip? 
Nice Guy Eddie: You don't believe in tipping? 
Mr. Blue: You know what these chicks make? They make shit. 
Mr. Pink: Don't give me that. She don't make enough money that she can quit. 
Nice Guy Eddie: I don't even know a fucking Jew who'd have the balls to say that. Let me get this straight: you don't ever tip? 
Mr. Pink: I don't tip because society says I have to. All right, if someone deserves a tip, if they really put forth an effort, I'll give them something a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, it's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doing their job.

It is if you can choose to work for yourself. Furthermore, equating an employer with being a master is quite a stretch. In a slave-master relationship the slave cannot choose not to obey their master. Metaphors aside, this simply is not the case in an employee-employer relationship.
While life in the USA is far from ideal,  anyone can choose to live wherever they can afford to live and work for whomever will hire them (including themselves). Slavery is fundamentally about not having choices.</td><td>0.3145168367952603</td><td>0.0779799569046646</td><td>0</td></tr>

Okay so where I'm from there's two times a year where you can put anything you want to throw out on your front lawn and it'll be picked up no cost. I don't know if it's just my home state that does this or if most states or even countries do this, where I'm living now used to but doesn't anymore, but that's a basic description of what happens. 
For kids it's like Christmas because it's common to go to others' trash piles and grab anything you like, one mans trash is another mans treasure am I right? I've gotten a desk chair, roller skates, toys, DVD players, a mini trampoline, etc. 
It's always fun to see what you can find.
And now onto the story and the malicious compliance:
So when I was 12 my mother sold a lot of our things, TVs and such included, and put anything we couldn't or didn't want to sell in storage while she dragged us all over the country for her book tour. We were homeless, living on the road and all that. 
Anyway, when we finally return to our home state we moved into a rental house in a city four hours from where we used to live. And then the unpacking happened, my mother had sold the family tv and so stole mine, which I'd purposely kept, and made that the family tv. I was understandably pissed since it wasn't my fault that she'd sold their tv, why'd I have to given up one of the only big items I'd been allowed to keep?
Months went by and then... then that glorious day came and my siblings and I were allowed to wander the nearby streets looking for hidden treasures. That year everyone had been transitioning from analog TVs to digital one so the streets were filled with analog TVs that were being thrown out, almost every house had one on their lawn.
I took my siblings home after some successful treasure hunting and begged my mother to help me bring one of the TVs home. It would've taken very little effort on her part to get the car and drive it to one of the TVs I had *walked to* and bring it home. We were both used to some heavy lifting so between the two of us it would've been a piece of cake and *free*!
But no... she refused, "If you want a TV so bad then you have to carry one back to the house by yourself!"
It wasn't a challenge or a tone that was in any way positive or encouraging.
It was a tone that said "I won't help you and you can't do it alone so just give up" with a hint of smugness, waiting for me to dejectedly walk to my room in defeat.
"Fine, just make sure to hold the door open for me when I get back so I can get it inside!" I turned and left, determined to prove her wrong.
"Yeah sure you will." She had replied, Sarcastically.
So I went front lawn to front lawn looking for a good TV. There were many that were way too big to carry and other that didn't have any good way for on singular person to grip them and would slip when I tried to pick them up. Eventually though, about two blocks from our house I found a, still relatively large, TV with two grip holds and was square enough for me to pick up. 
I lugged that thing, arms protesting and back aching, the whole way home and set it down right in front of the door.
Knock Knock Knock!
"MUM COME HOLD THE FRONT DOOR OPEN FOR ME!!"
The look on her face was *priceless*! She just stood there, dumbfounded, before I reminded her that I'd only done what she told me to do.
I brought that baby inside and placed it on my tv stand, where I proceeded to hook up my DVD player and give my mother a shit-eating grin when it turned on.
I had that TV for years until I eventually had to put it out on my own front lawn when I got a digital tv of my own.
The funny thing about this though, is that the TV had to be moved a couple of times while I owned it, moving house and the like, and I couldn't lift it again.

Basically I am supposed to train this girl on *my job.* I'm willing do that because I barely want this contract anymore and really don't care for it because of the crap I've had to put up with to retain it. This type of thing happens with this client *all the time*. I've been in this business for ten years and my complaints can be counted on one hand, and we have over seventy Google reviews, all 4 and 5-star ratings, many of them mentioning me by name. Then this client comes along. This was just kind of the last straw after three years.
>**Q:** Hey **Mr. X,** we're having some internet troubles here at the office, so I'm postponing with **\[NEW EMPLOYEE\]** until it's back up and running. I'm going to call her and go over what I can over the phone that doesn't require me to remote in or to show her anything  
>**X:** Will she be ready and through the training in the next hour and a half?  
>**X:** **Q**, I have to say I'm a little annoyed. **\[NEW EMPLOYEE\]** reports that you had another client during her training time, then you had network issues and were going to call her back, then never called her back. So now she's not trained for our meeting today so now my time is going to be wasted.  
>**Q:** I did have a client this morning and when it started to run long I let her know that it was running long and I would be a little delayed. I come into the office and **\[NET PROVIDER\]** is working on the lines right now which pretty much eliminates anything involving remote work. I had asked her for her phone number so that way I could call her Direct, but **\[NET PROVIDER\]** who is also my cell phone company, wasn't allowing access to 4G and I did not get the phone number until right about an hour ago. I'm very sorry that this happened, but understand all of it was out of my control  
>**X:** A word of advice in business, **Q**: nobody really cares about excuses. I hear your story but it doesn't affect anything from my end. What I see here is that your meeting ran long and there were some tech issues. In no other work environment other than mine would that be acceptable in any way shape or form. I could ask why you didn't go to a Starbucks. Or call from a landline. Or use your home internet. I never could have built my business if I had let little things like this get in the way of my ability to deliver results. You shouldn't either.
*Note:* He straight up asks why I can't ***go to Starbucks or go home***. I don't know, maybe because I have, like, a job? And our landline is a VOIP by the way as many are. Not to mention, my home net and the Starbucks here use the same provider we do...and they were out. The nearest Starbucks that doesn't use our provider is 45 minutes from the office.

Personally this is the only thing that irks me about this expansion, with all the cool cheap beasts I was so excited to see the new combinations, but alas, no.
**Edit:** cards will rotate out of his pool as they rotate out of standard, so rexxar's pool will shrink and shrink in standard.
**Edit 2:** [user] explained here that the main issue was the combining of text across the 15 languages hearthstone is playable in. Having to format the text so it lined up properly and looked proper is difficult especially in languages where the rules of sentence structure are different than in english.
**Edit 3:** to those asking about wild, Rexxar can use beasts from **Basic** through **Knights of the Frozen Throne** but as cards are added to wild, Rexxar will **NOT** gain new cards, just like how he does not gain any in standard with expansion releases.
**Edit 4:** Many people have come up with a very creative idea for the zombeasts to simply show the combined cards with some graphic upon hover-over instead of combining text. In hand, the card could read something like **Stonetusk Boar + Alleycat**.

We had this neat trip planned, we'd get flown into the middle of the park with out canoes, and canoe our way out over the course of a week.
First night, everything is pretty normal and cool.  Next day, we go over to the head of a trail up a mountain. (Mountain is a little bit of a misnomer, it's Ontario so our mountains are pretty small).  The base of the trail is in a campsite.  We get out of our canoes, and go up into the campsite to find the trail.
The campsite is a wreck.  Like, clothes tossed all around in the mud.  A dehydrated meal, that someone clearly hacked into with a knife, barely eaten.  Snack wrappers and trash.  A couple pairs of shoes.  Three different tarps, torn down and muddy.  A sleeping bag, I think.  Thing you wouldn't expect to be left behind, even with the messiest of campers.  No sign of anyone around (but plenty of evidence there had been at least 3-5 people here).  No sign of a canoe.  Keep in mind, this is a lake you can ONLY access via several days of canoing/hiking or a plane.  
To this day, we don't know what happened there.  It was a week before we got out of the park ourselves (and we were in a rough state when we did, it was a very rainy trip) so we never really found out what had happened.  Some members of our party said that they saw a canoe at the site the previous night (because they'd wanted that site, and it had been occupied.) but we woke up hella early and didn't see anything leave.  Our best guess is still that someone had an emergency (maybe hypothermia.  It was real rainy), they'd called out for an emergency rescue, and in their haste left behind a lot of stuff.
Edit: okay guys, I hear you, you think it was a bear.  I highly doubt it, and here's why:
- No tracks.  This is the big one
- The campsite was missing a lot of the essential things.  Like tents and packs.  They clearly had time to pack up *some* gear.
- There was a lot of partially eaten food out.  The dehydrated meal still had a spoon in it, and it had been opened in a way to make a bowl.  Bears don't have that much dexterity.  There was baggies of trail mix, still sealed.
- The mess was *very* human.  There were clothes that had been laid near the fire or over logs, and the shoes were also set up to dry.</td><td>Keep an eye on your blood oxygen level. You don't want to see that dip. Remember, the watch is a great indicator of what's going on, but it is no substitute for a real medical evaluation. If you notice something that bothers you, call your primary care provider's office and discuss it with a nurse. You might want to check with your insurance to see if they have a nurse hotline as well. Lastly, consider talking to your doctor about getting a sleep study. Remember, don't panic, but don't ignore.</td><td>0.6617656203833019</td><td>-0.0423299063714739</td><td>1</td></tr>

Had a used car dealership with a location in Fairbanks and another in Anchorage, and they wanted to buy websites from us, one per location. An important part of the website was getting the dealer's inventory on the site, including photos of the cars, VIN, features, options, yadda yadda.
Most customers could just send us a CSV export directly from their dealer management system, sometimes tab- or pipe-separated (and occasionally XML, ugh, I hated those) -- no problem, I had loads of existing code to deal with all of that, automated, as long as the export arrived by the time the import ran, Bob's your uncle.
This pair of dealers, however, ran an ADP system, which consisted of some sort of minicomputer running at each location, with a web interface which simply stuck a terminal emulator into a web page, green text and all. But they could export their data as a text file, so they sent it to me to look at.
This was not CSV. It was not tab-separated. It was not pipe-separated. Hell, it wasn't even XML. It was simply grouped lines of text, with control characters embedded (sprinkled about the file liberally). Each group had the same type of information, but it wasn't consistent -- the lines of information were not in the same order from record to record, the installed options were not in any sort of cohesive pattern and didn't consistently use common terms for features, and you might not even get the same number of lines in each record. There were significant issues with this file structure.
So we contacted ADP to see about getting a nice CSV export set up from the dealers. There was already an Excel file export on the web terminal page, so we figured a CSV export would be quick and easy, maybe even a feature that already existed and simply needed turned on.
ADP wanted to charge us fifty thousand dollars for them to write the CSV export.
The final import script I wrote simply extracted the VIN, mileage, and sale price from each record, and hit up our VIN lookup system for the rest.</td><td>0.6617658643907256</td><td>-0.079684614368622</td><td>1</td></tr>

User: I'm choosing the option for "international", but when I type New Mexico as the location, an error tells me I have to choose "domestic" for the type of transfer.
User: It's to New Mexico. Why is it telling me to choose domestic?
Colleague: (thinks for a second) Wait, what? You're sending it to New Mexico?
Colleague: I'm not sure what your issue is, ma'am. You're sending it to New Mexico, so that would be a domestic wire transfer.
User: NEWWWWWW Mexico, sir. Mexico isn't in the United States.
Colleague: Ma'am, New Mexico is one of the 50 states. If you're sending the wire to Mexico, you can select International. But if it's one of the 50 states, which New Mexico IS, then you need to select Domestic.
User: (still not understanding) I don't understand why you don't understand what I'm saying! It's NEW MEXICO!!!
Colleague: Yes, New Mexico. If you want to help your customer, then please select Domestic, and it should let you finish that wire transfer.
Eventually the girl relented and submitted the wire transfer as she was instructed. It's still not clear to my colleague whether she realized her mistake, or if she just did what she was told so her customer wouldn't get angry with the amount of time this was taking.
....Y'all, I can't help but wonder what was going through the mind of that customer, watching this girl (who was from TEXAS!!!) argue with tech support that a state right next door to her was a foreign country. I question the quality of her geography classes in high school.</td><td>I once hooked up an external hard drive to my Linux laptop, with the intent of wiping it for reuse elsewhere in my home network. But out of habit and muscle memory, I ran the "make new partition table" command on /dev/sda instead of /dev/sdb, and nuked the laptop's partition table *while it was running!* As usually happens in these matters, I almost immediately realized what I had done, marveled for an instant that the system remained totally operational, and began to contemplate my next steps.
I was saved by several factors: 1. unix-like operating systems typically cache a copy of the partition table and the directory tables in RAM when a partition is mounted; 2. I remembered a story I had previously read, from the days when VAXen roamed wild within the halls and dungeons of academia, about a user who nuked much of the system drive with an ill-advised "rm -rf /" command (or the VAX equivalent thereof), and the efforts undertaken by the system operators to restore the machine from backup tapes without any sort of shutdown, reboot, or indeed even a usable CPIO command; 3. a set of disk recovery utilities previously installed on the laptop; 4. knowledge of Recovery Rule #1: when you have accidentally deleted data, stop immediately and begin recovery operations; and 5. a curiousity to see whether or not I could actually do what I was about to attempt.
The attentive reader will note the absence of any mention of backups in the previous list of factors. The omission was not accidental.
Within a matter of moments, I began a scan of the drive using Photorec (yes, I am now scanning a nuked drive, by executing a program stored on the nuked drive). It soon found the original partition boundaries on the drive and allowed me to write a reconstructed partition table back onto the disk. Day and data saved, I went on with life, and the laptop functioned as if nothing had happened.</td><td>0.6617691087956113</td><td>0.0624632235870906</td><td>1</td></tr>

Do you think it will last? So  five years ago I was laying on my back in pain wishing someone would  shoot me after sliding off a church roof we'd been shingling.  I was 25  with shit insurance, 2 kids, a pregnant wife and making 28,000 a year.   That night while lying on my back stone still after taking 4 Advil I  decided there has to be a better way to make a living than this.
I  spent a couple months asking around for any job when one of my buddies  was like check out IT.  Then he goes on like "man we spend half the day  talking and bitching about stuff, then we go to lunch and have meetings.   This job is gravy and it pays great!"  He wouldn't tell me how much he  made but mentioned making 45k his first year in it.  I'm thinking, well  shit sign me up!
It took me about  a year to get up to speed.  I bought a cheap laptop from Walmart and  every night after work was on YouTube watching videos and practicing.   And let me tell you, I was a complete novice.  Like at the time I had a  smartphone but used an actual computer maybe once or twice a month and  that was to get on the internet.  I couldn't tell you the difference  between Chrome and Notepad, that's how little I know about computers.
But  I stuck with it and four years ago was hired at a hospital doing PC  support.  Pretty basic stuff like hooking up desktops or helping someone  with software the best I could.  Starting pay was 48k.  When they asked  me if that was reasonable I about fell out of my chair.  I'm thinking  hell yeah and insurance finally.  I still spent most every night  studying, I upgraded to a better desktop and started to dabble in cloud  technology (Azure at first).  The hospital provide Pluralsight training  that I started using for training in more advanced stuff (my boss told  me I had more hours logged than everyone combined).
Exactly  one year after I started at the hospital I walked in my managers office  and gave him my two weeks notice.  He said he figured this day was  coming and shook my hand the last day (we still go fish together).  Next  Monday I started a new job as a Linux administrator making 83k a year.   I remember logging in Workday at least a dozen times that week just to  look at that number.  83k, is this number correct?  Did the company make  a typo?  Never did I think I'd be making this kind of money in my life.
My  last goal was to get into security with a focus on cloud.  I did slow  down on the training after work to spend more time with family and I was  getting burned out from pushing so hard.  Plus we were finally able to  take family vacations, and wear new clothes while watching Netflix on a  huge TV together (that means a lot when you didn't have shit for your  family just a few years ago).
This  week I started my new job at a new company with the title  Associate  Security Engineer with my focus on web services.  I am making 110k.  I  don't even know how to feel about that but I like it!
(Also  I know I spoke a lot about money but this is a really fun career and I  do enjoy the challenge.  I don't even bitch about stuff that much.)
I  started this post to ask about salaries in IT but went off on a tangent  about my career.  I'm still in shock how high the pay is in this  industry and the thought does stay in the back of my mind are these  salaries going to last?</td><td>My wife's family put a jack-o-lantern on top of a CRT TV once when she was a child.

OK...not meals like we would, and do, eat. But it's food and it sustains them and their children. And much of it is ethnic based foods that are every inexpensive locally. Rice and flour are cheap in Asian countries where those the base of their ethnic foods. Same for Africa and South America. 
The real problem involving world hunger is things money can't control. Mostly drought. When food is brought into these areas suffering from sever drought local government officials or local warlords take control of the food. They then sell it or just give it to those who support them. And having UN troops on the ground doesn't do any good. UN troops are not allowed to use force to reclaim the food or when "guarding" the distribution of the food.
America was under such restrictions when we sent troops as part of these UN relief efforts. They can't use force, even when force is needed. The first few minutes of the movie "Black Hawk Down" shows this. And the use of some force would bring control and order in most situations when the world moves to help these humanitarian disasters.
There are far too many people living in poverty, this is true. But the majority of these people can buy, gather, or grow food on that low income.

Not enough for this Karen Hey guys, I've lurked here for a little while now, and figured I'd share a story from my my call centre days that you guys might appreciate. the full interaction of the call was around 45 minutes, with a lot of talking in circles as Karens tend to do, so I'm going to try my best to condense it down to the interesting parts
So this happened when I was supporting the floor for a team taking calls for a large  American cellphone company. The last agent on my team is taking their last call, and I'm just getting things ready to head out for the night (around midnight-ish, we're the last team to finish for the night) when the agent comes to my cubicle with a look of absolute dread. Immediate escalation. I toss on my headset and tell my agent to send her over as soon as possible. She cold transfers her to me, which I totally get, and I get my first blast from this Karen right out of the gate. K - Karen M- Me
M-"Hey there, Karen. I'm DBMaxx, and I am currently supervising the floor, I understand you're looking to talk with me, how can I help you out?"
I ask, but I have her account in front of me at this point, and see a bill coming due for a little more than $16000. I suspect this is going to be our issue.
K-"There is absolutely no fucking way I'm paying this bill, this is unacceptable!"
M-"Yeah no, I totally get where you're coming from. I definitely wouldn't be prepared for a bill like that, let me take a look and see whats going on here and get this sorted out."
It's at this point when I open the bill in question and see a roughly $16000 charge for roaming data. Uh-oh.
Karen here went on vacation to a very beautiful, yet very remote island. The going rate for data is an eye-watering $15 per megabyte. Karen used over a gigabyte of data while on this vacation.
Now I'm sure a lot of people are thinking "are there no protections that stop things like this from happening?" and you'd be absolutely right. We sent over 40 text messages warning about data use and notifying what the current charges for data were at the time, as well as turned off her data at the $500 mark, which she manually turned back on.
While I'm looking through the account figuring out what exactly happened here, Karen screams obscenities about how evil we are, and how I'm personally going to be jailed for this offence until I finally chime in and get the ball rolling.
M-"Okay, Karen, so just taking a look here, I can see the discrepancy in the bill is caused by a charge from data use while travelling, let me see if-"
K-"I did NOT use that much data, that is fucking ridiculous. How can you even say that, how stupid are you?"
M-"Well, taking a look here I see over a gigabyte of data usage on the week of 'the vacation', which, as you were advised, is billed at $15/mb"
K-"Nobody notified me of anything. There was no I could have known it would cost that much."
M-"I understand no employee advised you before your trip, but that is only because you never called us, and we had no idea your vacation was coming so soon."
K-"I was too busy to call you guys. I don't work for you guys, I don't know these things."
M-"I get that, but we also notified you over 40 times about these data charges, all of them including your current charge as well as the data rate for the area you're in. I understand this is a large bill, but we gave you every opportunity to call us and rectify the situation, and you chose not to, at this point I can offer you a maximum of $750 as a credit towards the charge."
K-"Are you fucking kidding me? $750? That's fucking nothing. I go on facebook and watch a FEW videos, and get THIS bill? You're such a fucking idiot I'm not paying a cent for this."
This is where things get interesting. I look through incredibly old policies on international travel, when I find one that actually lets me rerate charges from this particular country, for god-knows what reason, all the way down to $2/mb. Still a lot of money for a cell phone bill, but is sure as shit better than what she had right now. All in all the credit I could apply, using this policy to justify it, was about $14000. I'm ecstatic coming to the phone, this should be a slam dunk.
M-"So looking through some older policies, I've found one that allows me to apply 14 thousand(!!!) dollars to your account, thank you so much for being patient with me, I'm glad we could find a better solution here"
M-"Whoah there, let's not forget, even without the charge we're talking about, you still have your regular services to pay for."
K-"I feel like this has been horrible enough customer service, you should waive the charges for that to, it's the least you could do at this point."
M-"Well, I'm sorry to tell you, that's not how this works, and the absolute most I can apply is the 14 thousand I have already offered, and that alone is orders of magnitude larger than any other single credit I've personally applied."
K-"You're fucking heartless. I need to speak to YOUR boss right fucking now"
M-"If I could I would, but at this point it's almost 1AM where we're located and I'm quite literally the last person in this office, there is nobody above me you can talk to, if you'd like I can send her an email letting her know you would like to talk, she'll be in this morning."
M-"The email is sent, I've gotta warn you, though, she might not come up with the same solution I have."
So this ends my interaction with her, but then the department manager gets my email in the morning, thoroughly laying out the conversation the night prior, as well as my findings. My manager scrolls through the account quickly, laughs, then immediately puts on her headset and dials out to the customer. She very briefly, and very sternly advised the customer that this was not the first time a "mistake" like this has happened on the account, and and that due to these past interactions the most she would offer was a $25 courtesy credit, then advised any further inquiries about this issue would be forwarded to the fraud department for them to review. What a badass. A part of me feels bad about it, but the overwhelming majority of me says fuck that she did so many things to deserve that
TL:DR woman admittedly used phone on vacation, refused 14 thousand dollar credit towards her bill.

A few years ago I was the front office manager of a popular hotel brand in my town. We had some unfortunate circumstances within our rooms that led to many valid complaints with very little we could do to rectify the situation due to budgets and brand standards. I did the best I could with what I had, and was known for being not giving in to rude people and their demands. 
One day, a gentleman and his wife checked in and weren't overly rude at first but weren't particularly friendly either. The wife handled the check in process. After, they went and got their room set up and I watched them leave. They come back towards the end of my shift, about 10pm, and go up to the room. 
Within 5 minutes, the husband is standing angrily at my desk. I mentally prepare myself and step out of the back office... 
Husband: "We turned the heat up to 90 degrees (Fahrenheit) and our room is only 75! This is outrageous, we are going to freeze tonight!"
Me: (internally wondering where the fuck it is acceptable to sleep in a 90 degree room in the states) "I do apologize sir, unfortunately our individual thermostats will not go above 75 degrees. You can set them higher, but the system will not allow for the temperature to rise that high. I see you have our king suite which allows enough room for a space heater. Would you like me to bring you one?"
Husband: "a space heater?! Are you kidding me?! I want my heat to go up to the temperature I set it to and nothing else! I won't be sleeping with a space heater, and I WILL be sleeping in a 90 degree room!"
Me: "Again sir, I do apologize, but that isn't an accommodation I can provide. I have some extra blankets I could deliver to your room, with or without the space heater to help keep you comfortable."
Husband: "not acceptable. I can't believe you won't give me what I want. Call maintenance."
Me: "I cannot do that sir, it is almost 1030pm and we are only authorized to call maintenance after hours for emergencies."
Husband: "this is an emergency. I want your manager and maintenance man here NOW."
Me: "I am the manager on duty and I will not be calling anyone else to come into the hotel tonight. I have offered the solutions available to you, would you like to take advantage of the blankets or space heater tonight?"
Husband: "No. I demand compensation for my troubles. I will not be able to sleep tonight and my wife will not be happy. What are you going to do for me."
Me: "Of course, I understand. I am happy to offer you 250 bonus points for your stay if you were interested in skipping housekeeping tomorrow, what do you think?"
Me: "Additionally, I can let the breakfast attended know to extend your room complimentary breakfast for the remainder of your stay."
Husband: "its about time you did something useful. Thanks for wasting my time." *walks back to room*
The malicious part? Well, you see, his wife had already signed up to skip housekeeping for those extra points during check in. He wasn't paying attention when she did that. I also work for a chain that breakfast is always complimentary. I compensated his troubles with rewards he was already entitled to and he was none the wiser. His wife left a 4 star review and we had no complaints for the rest of their stay. I did have to make sure housekeeping turned the thermostat back down after they left though.</td><td>My old boss did something like that a couple years ago.

Episode 1
 - Thomas - Me, the manager and network admin
 - John - The older of my two other reports, primarily responsible for server maintenance, major application upgrades, and supporting our smaller off-site locations and their specific applications
 - Daniel - The younger of my two original employees, though here for the same amount of time as John.  Both longer than me, actually.  Desktop and server support, document management and phone system support, phenomenal people skills.
A little over a week has come and gone.  Jordan remains steadfast in his attempts to drive me and my other two reports to the brink of insanity.  Thus far he has failed a stunningly easy test I devised to assess his problem-solving skills, admitted to underage drinking, attempted to build camaraderie in a conversation with us all by saying "you guys know how hard it is to pull one over on my mom", and argued with me about the importance of locking computers when leaving them unattended.  
While he was away from his desk performing a task and I was talking idly with John and Daniel, I walked over to inspect the clutter Jordan had already amassed and noticed a password written on a sticky note.  
Ah, an opportunity to teach an important lesson.  I mentioned it to John and Daniel, and then waited.
"Jordan, what's wrong with your desk?" I asked upon his return.  
Daniel, who had been listening to the exchange from his desk, poked his head out from behind his monitors.
"Yeah," Jordan replied.  "It's that [anti-virus] management password you gave me.  You told me to write it down so I wouldn't forget it."
"I didn't tell you to write any password down."
I cut in, stopping the conversation and telling Jordan not to worry about it right then.  I again explained the importance of locking unattended computers, and let the issue drop until later in the day when I called him into my office.
"Close the door behind you.  About that password."
"Daniel gave me that password."
"I spoke to Daniel and he said he doesn't remember giving you that password and definitely wouldn't have told you to write it down.  You're sure?"
Intent on giving Jordan every opportunity to come clean I tried again.
"Like I said, I talked to Daniel and he's certain that he didn't give you that password.  I have to agree; it wouldn't be like him to tell you or anyone to write down a password."
"I'm positive he gave it to me and told me to write it down so I wouldn't forget."
"Jordan, I know for a fact that Daniel didn't give you that password."
"*I* gave you that password.  In an email, which also explained that you should change it when you log in the first time."
"Listen, Jordan.  I've known the whole time what was up and I've been trying to give you the chance to be honest, but you chose right from the start to throw Daniel straight under the bus.  That's not the way to build a good working relationship with your coworkers.  If you keep that up no one is ever going to trust you."
The conversation ended.  No apology, no remorse, no assurances it wouldn't happen again.  I reported this chain of events to my director, knowing that such a claim of dishonesty on the part of the HR director's son would best be handled between the two directors.  My cries would fall upon deaf ears.
The chronicles would continue.

They ran some blood work and found that her total bilirubin is very high (thus the jaundice) and also a mass near her liver.
I was supposed to bring her back in this morning to get an abdominal ultrasound to confirm if it is cancerous, but the vet said it's an 85% that it is. My cat is very old and if it is cancerous, I am not going to put her through chemotherapy or any surgeries. I don't think she can handle it, and also I don't want her last days to be miserable going through treatments.
I am planning on keeping her at home with me until her condition worsens and when I think it's time to put her down (which I will also do at home with an at-home euthanasia service so she dies at home with me). 
My main question is this: I am wondering if it is even worth it to take her back in to get the ultrasound. She is very sick, and it seems the only thing the ultrasound will do is confirm it's cancer and give me an estimate of how bad it is. But being there last night was really difficult for her. I'm wondering if I should even put her through the stress of bringing her back in for more tests, when it seems that the course of action is going to be the same no matter what (keeping her here with me until she passes).
Do you think that this is the right choice? Or do you think I should take her in to get the ultrasound? 
Also, if anyone can offer me tips on how to handle this and get through this, it would really be appreciated. She is the love of my life and I feel like my whole world is ending right now.

In the first James Byrd Jr. episode, the Captain repeatedly calls various men 'sissies'. He might not know the weight of this word, in that it's been used to mock and emasculate gay men for decades, so again I gave him a pass. 
Then, he started joking that two men were writing 'kissy faces' to each other in letters, and holding hands with each other in their truck. I'm sure the Captain would be lightning quick to say he's not homophobic and "has gay friends!!", but these comments are flat-out homophobic.

I sigh and sit near the stall. And tell my mom to calm down, it's okay. Finally after another fifteen minutes, the stall opens and the woman exits.

As the term is used legally, witness testimony is a form of evidence (aside, this is why many news articles that say Trump claims things "without evidence" are incorrect). A he said/she said should not be enough for a criminal conviction, but in civil court all you need is for one side to be a little more credible than the other.
Apparently, the jury found the eyewitness testimony including corroboration from her friends of an outcry at the time more credible than Trump's denials. It probably didn't help that even his supporters would admit the guy is a serial liar. Also, the fact that he didn't testify. Or that his "she's not my type" defense lost a lot of credibility when he mistook her for his wife in an old photo.

We plan to replace the N5k with slightly "larger" Nexus 9300 and the N2K with slightly "smaller" Nexus 9300 as fabric extenders.
Now there are three possibilities from my point of view:
1.	⁠Rebuild the current design(Fex mode)

Two 9300 form a vpc domain and each of the two gets four fabric extenders assigned.

It once was California’s largest silver mine, has a population of 4500, and was known to have a murder a week. Currently it has a population of 1. AMA Hello reddit!
My name is Brent and with my friend Jon purchased the former mining town of "Cerro Gordo" this past July 13th (Friday the 13th). The town was originally established in 1865 and by 1869 they were pulling 340 tons of bullion out of the mountain for Los Angeles. 
The silver from Cerro Gordo was responsible for building Los Angeles. The prosperity of Cerro Gordo demanded a larger port city and pushed LA to develop quickly.  
The Los Angeles News once wrote:
"What Los Angeles is, is mainly due to it. It is the silver cord that binds our present existence. Should it be uncomfortably severed, we would inevitably collapse."
In total, there has been over $17,000,000 of minerals pulled from Cerro Gordo. Adjusted for inflation, that number is close to $500,000,000.
It's been a wild ride so far owning a 'ghost town' and we're having a lot of fun figuring out what to do with it.

The DA would have to prove that she knowingly committed bad-faith homicide.
This is not true. 
Murder, as defined in Texas Penal Code Section 19.02, only requires:
>(1)  intentionally or knowingly causes the death of an individual;
Intentionally and knowingly are defined in Section 6.03:
>(a)  A person acts intentionally, or with intent, with respect to the nature of his conduct or to a result of his conduct when it is his conscious objective or desire to engage in the conduct or cause the result.
>(b)  A person acts knowingly, or with knowledge, with respect to the nature of his conduct or to circumstances surrounding his conduct when he is aware of the nature of his conduct or that the circumstances exist.  A person acts knowingly, or with knowledge, with respect to a result of his conduct when he is aware that his conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.
The officer intentionally pulled her weapon with the express intent on shooting Jean. Shooting someone with a firearm is *per se* deadly force in Texas. Even if the cop didn't specifically intend to kill Jean, firing her weapon is per se deadly force, and a police officer would certainly know that.
Manslaughter is defined as:
> (a)  A person commits an offense if he recklessly causes the death of an individual.
Recklessness is defined in Chapter 6 as:
>(c)  A person acts recklessly, or is reckless, with respect to circumstances surrounding his conduct or the result of his conduct when he is aware of but consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the circumstances exist or the result will occur.  The risk must be of such a nature and degree that its disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that an ordinary person would exercise under all the circumstances as viewed from the actor's standpoint.
The difference here is regarding the defendant's mental state as it pertained to the result of the conduct. Criminal "intent" requires that you intend the consequences of your actions, while recklessness does not. You could argue that here conduct constituted a "gross deviation from the standard of care", but you can also easily see how she specifically intended to shoot Jean. Recklessness generally applies when someone did not necessarily intend the consequences of their actions, but said actions were clearly reckless towards the risk of harm to human life.
Texas doesn't require any other premeditation, malice aforethought, or "bad-faith" mental state. Killing someone else is generally against the law, so if you are going to do it, you need a valid legal reason.
No one is arguing that the officer didn't intend to shoot Jean. The officer is saying that she had a valid legal reason by raising the justification of self defense (TPC Sec. 9.32) based on a mistake of fact (TPC Sec. 8.02).
Let's also be clear that the officer was arrested for manslaughter, but the Dallas DA has said that when the case goes before the grand jury, they can consider a murder charge. Whether the DA tries hard for a murder charge, whether the grand jury indicts on murder or a lesser charge, or if the defendant ultimately pleads to a lesser charge, will largely be based on compromises made by those in the system based upon the tricky facts, the tricky law, and the defendant's status as a cop. Even if the grand jury returns a murder indictment, I could easily see a plea bargain for manslaughter or negligent homicide in order to guarantee a conviction rather than run the risk of a not guilty verdict or hung jury at trial.</td><td>I've seen lots of conservatives saying liberals are mad at these ads.

We plan to replace the N5k with slightly "larger" Nexus 9300 and the N2K with slightly "smaller" Nexus 9300 as fabric extenders.
Now there are three possibilities from my point of view:
1.	⁠Rebuild the current design(Fex mode)
8 N9k 9300 are driven in FEX mode
Two 9300 form a vpc domain and each of the two gets four fabric extenders assigned.
2. new topology: collapsed core (all standalone with back to back vpc)
2.1 Layer 2 only with back to back vpc 
The two slightly larger 9300 models form the core layer (N9K_1 + N9K_2 )vpc domain 1 ).
So every Access pair has a uplink to N9K_1 and one uplink to N9K_2
 
2.2 layer 3 HSRP at aggression vpc connected with  always 2 pair of Switches in VPC as access to keep up the portchannels on two switches  for servers.

So 1 day off every 3 months. None of us in the office get ANY benefits. No PTO, no medical, no holidays, nothing. We were also told that because we (the hygienists) are booked out so far that when we take our day off we will have to come in early or work late to make up for the patients we didn't see that day.
Me and the other hygienists all put in our letters of resignation today. We all typed letters and laid them on his desk. So he got back from lunch and had to read through all the letters. My coworker told me that she saw him throw our stack of letters at the office manager while saying "look at this."
Fortunately hygienists are in crazy high demand in CA right now and all of us already have other job offers.
Tl;dr - boss tries to control our unpaid time off and vastly overestimates his worth. Winds up losing his whole clinical staff.
Update since this blew up: for everyone that's calling BS, I posted my resignation letter and screen shots of texts in the comments. I had one prepared already but I made another one at lunch and printed it out because I felt like I needed to specify that I was quitting because of the policy on unpaid overtime. And yes I did print it out at work lol. 
Update 2: my boss decided to act like nothing happened. He didn't mention anything or even say a word about it to me and the other staff members that were quitting. My coworker did see him toss the resignation letters at our office manager and say "look at this..."
The doctor and my office manager were also in a meeting by themselves at 5pm. He always leaves at around 330 so it was satisfying to see him staying late to sort this out. They both gave me a death stare when I walked by the little window to the room they were in though.

Move to somalia" argument.
I for one am not American (Frenchman reporting), yet I'm for complete freedom to bear arms.
/t/TaKKyN1123 is correct in saying that the constitution is a hindrance to progression, in fact it is in several ways, but I'll just focus on one:
The vocabulary and scope of the constitution is based upon the perspective of the USA at the time, "militia" would have made sense, now much less.
Thus it would be a net positive to clarify it by explicitely saying "The right to bear arms of any kind by any citizen of the USA shall not be infringed in any way by Congress", thus removing all doubt about it.
Anoher reason the constitution hinders progress is the Commerce Clause, which is way too vague, and thus allows the federal government to regulate pretty much everything.
My point is that **one can hold criticism of the constitution while being a libertarian.**
**Self-promotion**: If any French-speaking people lurks here, please manifest yourself , as a Frenchman *l'anti-libéralisme* (anti-libertarianism) is dominant in society, it would be positive to see how much are we here. *(Also, please check /r/liberaux for a French-speaking (Francophone) libertarian subreddit)*</td><td>The Lefty's On Reddit are Out of Control So, there's this post on /r/philosophy and someone mention the words "climate change denier", which is a phrase I take intellectual exception to. I posted the following, rational response and had it censored. 
"This phraseology "climate change denier", is not only inaccurate, it is insulting. Nobody seriously denies that the climate is warming and nobody calls themselves a "climate change denier". That is a label given to people who are skeptical of the claims of doom and gloom made by the eco-warriors.
What is a matter of debate is whether the change is man-made and whether it is something to be alarmed about. Despite what some would have you believe, science is never settled and there are legitimate scientific reasons to question the consensus that the climate's change is anthropogenic in nature and that a crisis is imminent if not already happening.
There was a time when Eugenics was the consensus best way to improve humanity. Science is not done by consensus and skepticism is a fundamental part of science.
Using the word denier is not only inaccurate for the reason mentioned before, it is insulting because it tries to attribute the same negative feelings associated with holocaust deniers.
"The world is literally a greener place than it was 20 years ago." This according to NASA. Worldwide, poverty is at all time lows. America—a large, high-tech country that accounts for about 25% of the global economy—is now generally using less of most resources year after year, even as its economy and population continue to grow. What's more, the US is polluting the air and water less, emitting fewer greenhouse gases, and replenishing endangered animal populations.
The bottom line is that the climate change hysteria is not a science-based movement. It is a political movement. Scientist don't call skeptics of their science "Heretics". That is more the language of a religion than it is of science."

She calls about 4 times a day. I used to always hang up, thinking they were robo calls for some sort of scam. But about two weeks ago I decided to see if I could get past the Allison bot and talk to a human.
It was very easy. "Allison" asked me if I had car ins, and I said yes. Then how many cars I insured, and I said 'three'. She asked for my zip code and my insurer, and I gave her a zip from another state and a random company "State Farm". Then I got connected to a human. It was a salesperson for a real insurance company in another state, near the zip code I had given them. I got the name of  agency and while talking to them I looked up the company on Facebook. Once I found the agency, I hung up and left a review on their FB page saying that they contacted me through an Allison-bot robo call, and that I got those calls several times a day, and that it made me feel like the company was desperate and shady so I would never use them for insurance. I was careful to be truthful.
Since then, everytime I get an Allison bot call, I do the same thing: give some random zip code and whatever insurance company name I think of at the time. I give info to get to a human, find out the company and leave a review saying they robo called me and I didn't like it.
Today I got a human, and got their agency name. This time I told the guy what I was going to do and how angry these repeated calls made me. He immediately sounded anxious, and practically begged me not to leave a review. I said that if I got one more, I would. He promised to take me off the robocall list with the company he contracted with.
I don't know if that will work, but if not, I will keep leaving reviews. If they are fine with calling me dozens of times a week, I'm fine leaving reviews saying how annoyed I am about it.</td><td>This is bad. Live coverage can be found here and on Twitter. 
On top of firing 5000 rockets in a short time, Hamas vehicles were able to overrun a border checkpoint and have been driving around the Israeli border town of Sderot (population 30,000). Videos and photos show them indiscriminately shooting at civilian vehicles and taking civilian hostages on the street, along with photos of dead civilians I won't share here. Allegedly, they took over a police station and went after civilians in shelters. Reports of large numbers of civilian casualties and some kidnappings have begun to appear as well.
The commander of Hamas has called for Israeli Arab civilians (20% of the country) to rise up in armed rebellion and is also asking for support from Israel's Arab neighbor states.
 
Meanwhile, Israel has declared a state of war, called up their reserves, and begun a massive bombing campaign in Gaza. This is the most significant attack on the Israeli homeland in 50 years. Given the current government, I would expect an overwhelming response in Gaza, with boots on the ground not out of the question.</td><td>0.682075344929588</td><td>-0.0115172245193331</td><td>2</td></tr>

Determinism.

Could they have been wrong? Maybe, that is what the "ocular trap" is, to be bound to a future you see. Paul leaves the path because he didn't foresee Leto II which pushes him off the exact ledge you are describing; "maybe there is or was another way that I missed".

In the past 12 or so hours since the end of the OSU v. Clemson game I've seen a lot of hot takes, misunderstandings, and straight up misinformation about what is or isn't a catch. I thought I'd try and do a write up of this call in particular, mainly because what I've seen thus far seems inadequate.
If you want the **TLDR: I think they got the call correct by overturning it.**
Without further ado, let's break this down.
The NCAA provides for us the rules free of charge. I'll go ahead and copy out the relevant sections here:
> Catch, Interception, Recovery
>> a. To catch a ball means that a player:
>>> 1. Secures firm control with the hand(s) or arm(s) of a live ball in flight before the ball touches the ground, and
>>> 3. Maintains control of the ball long enough to enable him to perform an act common to the game, i.e., long enough to pitch or hand the ball, advance it, avoid or ward off an opponent, etc., 
>> h. When in question, the catch, recovery or interception is not completed. 
We will circle back to these later
>Procedures
>> c. All reviews shall be based upon video evidence provided by and coming directly from the televised production of the game or from other video means available to the replay official that is also available to the television producer. 
I do not have a copy of the CCA Mechanics Manual, but at this level of football, officials are instructed to beanbag fumbles and review them in the booth. If one of the NCAA officials on here could copy out the phrasing, please do.
So now that we've established these lets jump right in
These are enumerated above, but to expand on them:
* Tucking the ball
* Extending the ball for the goal line
* Moving the ball away from a defender
* Advancing under your own power
* Taking steps BY ITSELF is not an act common to the game. Maintaining feet from the point of contact is not indicative in and of itself a move common to the game. Imagine in this hypothetical scenario that that the Clemson WR had remained with his hands on the ball and went to the ground. He would have been marked down by forward progress where he initially contacted the ball, as he did not actively make these steps. So lets dispense with that one right now.
* Trying to do any of the above and failing in the process is not indicative of a move common to the game.
* The speed of the ball carrying it to your helmet is not a move common to the game. 
**Looking at replays and thinking through the process**
Unfortunately these are the only clips I have from the game, as most of the articles through page 3 of google simply use the sportscenter slowmo. If anyone has other clips please send them too me so I can edit it in.
So full speed, the HLJ is perfectly in position to make this call. He's about 3 yards from the play, judging by where his hat is pointed he's staring right at this catch. As soon as he sees the ball come out, he drops his beanbag and runs to the GL for the reverse mechanic, and the R signals the TD. As a scoring play, it immediately goes to review.
Looking back at the mechanics manual, the HLJ drops the bean bag to cover himself. If he blows the whistle and it was in-fact a fumble for a TD, he's probably never going to work a CFP game again for having an inadvertent whistle on a scoring play.
Now that we are in the review, we need to have firm control, and an act common to the game.
Full Speed Front View - From here we can see that the steps taken are from the force of contact by the DB from the moment of catching, the steps alone do not count as our move common. This leaves an attempt to ward or tuck.
Slow Motion Back Cam - From 0:03 to 0:05 we can see the WR left hand come off of the ball while attempting to tuck it to his waist, at which point the ball is dislodged by the DB.
Given this, I don't think this is a catch, but it's still a very close call.
Circling back to subsection h, *"When in question, the catch, recovery or interception is not completed."* Given that the HLJ let the play go as he wasn't sure it was a catch or not, and that it seems unclear after looking at this all day whether he completes his act common, this is ruled incomplete.
For games such as this, the call is reviewed at the SEC HQ, the replay booth, and on the field. Given that all crews independently came to the same conclusion, I feel quite confident that this was the right call.
*Can the replay booth/HQ overrule the field crew?*
No, the ruling of the white hat on the field is final. That said, he is subject to a post game review process by the conference.
*But what about hypothetical scenario involving goal line/out of bounds?*
You have to maintain control while doing your move. Simply catching the ball is not enough, it has to be maintained through contact \(see this play\)
I'll add more as I see them come in
*Do you have more clips like this?*
Here's a video where Redding breaks down a very similar play in TAMU v. UA. Notice how the WR successfully tucks and turns under his own power before it's immediately stripped.
Here's a video in which it was called an incompletion, TAMU vs. LSU. WR never completes his act common to the game before losing control.
This is an incompletion. Steps do not matter if you don't have control.</td><td>The internet is mined in Australia and then is sent to Ireland. The straight-line distance from Sydney to Dublin is around 10K miles (16K km) and takes 10 months. So call it 1000 miles or 1600km per month and calculate from there. 
Where the source is either Australia or Ireland depending on whether the Irish bless everyone's internet or whether other countries get it straight from Australia. Note that Australia and Ireland are almost antipodes, so almost any other place on earth is closer to one of them than 10K miles and would therefore be shorter than 10 months.

My JNMIL is one that keeps card companies in business. She has always sent cards for every occasion and holiday. We're not talking just birthday and anniversaries. We're talking every single holiday like Valentine's day, St Patrick's day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, 4th of July, you name it (except mother's day and Father's day--dare she ever see us as parents!)
Since things have gotten strained, she still send cards but instead of being "my son and daughter in law" it's "my son and his wife". There's a clear transition here when the cards moved from daughter in law to sons wife.

The internet *must* know your IP address, in order for it to be able to send you the data that you request when you pull up a web page or fetch your email. If the internet *didn't* know your IP address, you won't get any cat videos.
Furthermore, "your" IP address *doesn't belong to you*, plus it changes periodically. It belongs to the ISP that you get your internet service from; they just lease it out to you.
So, what you want to do is use a dynamic DNS service, or DDNS, something like No-IP or Dyn. You'll set up an account with one of those services, pick a domain name, then run a small program on your server which will update that domain name with the IP address currently assigned to your router (it's likely that your router has the capability built into it, so you wouldn't need to install anything anywhere else). Also, forward the ports in your router necessary for them to connect to your Minecraft server.
Now, you just tell your Minecraft friends to connect to your server at myminecraftserver.dynamicdnsservice.tld (don't use that, because it's fake; replace it with your actual dynamic domain name). They can technically still get your IP address, but *that doesn't matter*. And at this point, all they could do with the IP address is exactly what they can do with your DDNS domain name: connect to your Minecraft server, and maybe run a port scan, which at this point would only show the Minecraft server.
BTW, having an IP address *does not* give anyone your exact location. The *best* it can do is show that you use a specific ISP and are located somewhere within a couple hundred square miles of the address on record for that ISP's local office. And for some ISPs, they don't associate IP addresses with specific office locations, so your IP address might locate you to a spot thousands of miles away from your actual geographical location, i.e. the headquarters office of the ISP.</td><td>0.6820890438668784</td><td>0.1033397746084527</td><td>2</td></tr>

I'm petty sure the US can't unilaterally kick anyone out of NATO, and there is roughly zero chance of the US sanctioning Germany.

I quit my job, flipped my LinkedIn status to 'willing to hear from recruiters' flew home and spent a few days catching up with house/motorcycle/dental/car repairs, cat feeding and sleeping on a sopophoric couch.  
  
I log back into LinkedIn to nothing I can take- temp to perm jobs three states away, sales positions and ill-formed "do everything like a senior but pay you like an intern" positions.   
  
I even think about picking up some litigation work, but that smells like failure.  
  
I drop a line to two technical recruiters I like and ask for some contract work to tide me over.  
  
One, who we'll call Burt, calls me back that afternoon.  
  
Burt:"Hey, I saw you were looking for short term work. I have an, er, odd request and you might be interested"    
  
I hear a buzzing sound in the background, but assume it's just noise on the line.
  
  
Burt:"This isn't one of my normal clients. They need to figure out their backups and possibly recover some data. It's urgent, so the faster you can get here, the faster you'll get paid. I'll guarantee that part if you make them happy"  
  
I get a contact, an address and a phone number. I tell Burt I'll be there this afternoon and make my self presentable, collect some tools, then ride out there on my motorcycle.  
  
I arrive, find a place to park and busy my self with getting my suit jacket and laptop bag off the bike while securing my motorcycle gear in my saddlebags.  
  
A middle aged woman has left her beige sedan and is walking towards me with a "I want to talk to your manager" air.  
  
Beige Camry:"Don't you know you'll never amount to anything riding that death machine?"  
  
I'm still fumbling with my remove sunglasses, pull regular glasses from their case, place sunglasses in case, remove helmet, put glasses on my face without dropping anything or poking myself in the eye with the glasses, so I don't pay Beige Camry much attention.  
  
  
Beige Camry:"You won't go to college and you won't make it past 30 doing stupid things"  
  
I'm now paying attention. I'm still confused. I look around to make sure she's addressing me. She is. She's planted her nurse shoe wearing feet and wants to give me both barrels.  
  
me:"I've made it past 30 and graduated college, but I still do stupid things. Thank you for the compliment"  
  
I go back to the stowing and bungee cording while she glares, then walks off, towards a building next to the parking lot.  
  
A few minutes later, I'm respectably wearing a suit jacket with my laptop bag slung over my shoulder looking for my destination.   
  
I find my destination and the appropriate office suite. It turns out to be the Law Offices of Amygdala and Euripides, PC . The receptionist tells me to wait in a waiting room with outdated magazines while I hear the buzz of drills.  
  
A middle aged man introduces himself as Mr Euripides and ushers me back to his cramped office.  
  
Me:"So, I understand you have some problems with backups"  
  
Euripides:"We do. We switched providers and now everything is messed up."  
  
Me:"Ok. By 'service', we're talking a managed service provider- a contractor who handles technical issues, sets up systems and the like'?  
  
Euripides:"Yes. The old one was too expensive. They were charging us rent on a file server, so we terminated the contract. I had my nephew build a new server and connect it to a cheaper backup service"  
  
  
Euripides:" About two weeks ago, we lost all our files on the server and neither of the backups work. Each blames the other and they start talking technobabble. I threatened them with litigation, but that didn't get my files back." 
  
Me:"I think I understand. I speak fluent technobabble. Let me take a look and I'll give you an estimate on the costs"  
  
Euripides:"Burt is taking care of that part"  
  
I'll have to figure out what that means. I'm here, so I should at least take a look. Lawyer hands me a wrinkled sheet of paper and walks me to a louder room. It seems that their IT closet is in a construction zone. There's sheet rock dust, saw dust and a few broken drop-ceiling tiles' worth of detritus on a single open rack.  
  
At the bottom of the rack are two flashy gaming PC towers. Translucent Lucite sides with LED light strips show me a stack of hard drives . Clearly the builder was thinking about a different kind of Enterprise than I was.  
  
I turn to Euripides. 
  
  
Lawyer:"My nephew's number is on that paper. I don't understand all this stuff anyway. Anything else you need from me?"  
  
me:"Let me take a look and I'll call your nephew if I have any questions"  
  
He walks off while I grab a spare keyboard and monitor from an unused cubicle. I plug into the PC on the left and use a password on the sheet to login.  
  
A bit of poking and the OS sees one mountable volume, but four drives. Seems they're some kind of RAID. One drive is showing a hardware failure.  
  
That's odd, but perhaps that's because Windows isn't my strength. I reboot the first PC from a linux USB drive and move my monitor and keyboard to number 2.  
  
This one is a bit happier. I see two volumes mounted. One for the OS, one for file storage.  
  
  
This might be easier than I thought.  
  
I look through the backups and see one per day, going back about a month or two.  
  
I pick one from about two weeks ago. It's compressed, so it's going to take a few minutes. I swap back to the first PC, which has booted linux.  
  
Ok. Four drives. I can mount the OS drive fine. One dead. Remaining two a part of an array. I don't get it. Assuming RAID 5, one drive can fail and we can still read and write data. I need to think on this for a second.  
  
Back to the other PC to see how the restore's coming. That was fast. I open the folder and see a full backup.  
  
Of the operating system. Not the file storage. I check the other backups and they're all the same size. Great.   
  
Then I notice something that makes me sad. The OS volume is 4TB. The Storage volume is 12TB. One drive, three drives.   
  
There's no parity, the drives aren't mirrored. If any one fails, the whole volume fails.   
  
I find Lawyer's nephew's number and call it. I get voicemail. I tell him to call me back.  
  
So my local backups aren't and the one volume that holds the data is borked.  
  
This is going to be complicated. I call Bart, the recruiter who brought me in.  
  
  
me:"Uh, not so well. I have a feeling this is going to be expensive."  
  
  
me:"We might have to ship out three drives for recovery. We're talking a few thousand to start"  
  
  
me:"I don't have a clean room. I might swap a hard drive controller board, but this is magic by comparison."  
  
  
me:"I have one last thing to try, but I'm not feeling lucky. Give me an hour"  
  
  
  
Bart:"Yep. I'll pay you for your time and barter with Euripides"  
  
  
I look at the other number on the paper. It's a local MSP named OnFight. I call the number. After a few minutes in a phone tree inspired by the maze in Zork 1, I exit the twisty passages and get to Joel, a support rep.  
  
Joel:"HithisisJoelatOnFightpleasehold"  
  
  
hold music, occasionally interrupted by short, amateur commercials about how _awesome_ OnFight's service is.  
  
Joel:"HithisisJoelthankyouforwaiting. What'sthecustomernumber?"  
  
me:"I'm trying to reach whomever manages your backups. I don't have a customer number, but the customer is Law Offices of Amygdala and Euripides, PC."  
  
  
me:"Wait wait wait. Can I talk to a manager for five minutes? I think can solve a problem for you all if I can talk to someone who can make a quick decision"  
  
  
The wait isn't as long.  
  
Manager:"Hi there. This is Rebecca. What's this about Amygdala and Euripides?"  
  
me:"Thanks. You used to rent them a server and do their backups, right?"  
  
Rebecca:"That's correct. A few months ago we got told to take the server back and to stop the backups"  
  
me:"Ok, got that. Is there any chance you haven't wiped that server?"  
  
Rebecca:"We overwrote the drive,  reformatted the server and allocated it to a new customer. Backups securely overwritten per A&E's request"  
  
  
Rebecca:"That's correct. We have emails from Euripides' nephew and a signed letter from Euripides himself"  
  
  
I call Nephew again.  
  
  
me:"Hi. This is Lawtechie. I'm trying to figure out your backups"  
  
  
me:"Let me understand. The shiny box on the left is the primary and the one on the right is the backup?"  
  
  
me:"It looks like you're only backing up the C: drive"  
  
  
me:"You're backing up the operating system on a nightly basis"  
  
  
me:"No, that's reinstallable. What about the various documents your uncle's law practice actually runs on?"  
  
  
  
  
me:"There's a lesson every techie learns. If you don't test your backups, you don't have any"  
  
Nephew:"We shouldn't need them. Those disks are RAID"  
  
me:"You sure? It looks like you set them up without mirrors or parity"  
  
  
me:"I think you should learn some things before building systems that people rely on next time"  
  
Nephew:"Yeah. I'm going into cybersecurity soon so that stuff won't matter"  
  
me:"Good for you. That's a business where charlatans and the soulless run rampant. There's also a negative side."  
  
  
me:"Is there any chance there's a full backup anywhere else somewhere?"  
  
  
me:"Tried that. Seems that you told them to burn it all"  
  
  
me:"I wish you luck in your career"  
  
  
I texted Bart to tell him that it wasn't looking good, then I walked to Euripides' office to tell him about hard drive recovery. He thanked me in the way people do when they think you're trying to take advantage of them and said that he'd talk to his nephew before making any important decisions.  
  
Bart paid me for that day and I went home.</td><td>Trust me: the internet knows your IP address.

In the 2019 Canadian election, the conservative party received the most votes of any party but got fewer seats than the liberals and did not get to form a government. Conservatives received 34% of the vote compared to 33% for the liberals. However, liberals got 46% of the seats compared to 36% for the conservatives.
Of course, that's how the system works. But that doesn't stop people from complaining about the popular vote in the US in 2016.</td><td>0.6617768542103968</td><td>0.0240185270142788</td><td>2</td></tr>

On top of that the poorer you are the more likely you are to be shot even among the poor class. (source) By blaming the institution of police on the problems of the people politicians are using race to shield their own failures.

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>NESTLE Swiss food giant Nestle will set up a   global research and development center for snack foods next year in   Sderot, a town in Israel's Negev desert, the Maariv newspaper reported   on Sunday.</td><td>According to this, you can register if you didn't vote before, but you can't vote in the runoff if you voted for Senate in another state in 2020.</td><td>Everything every BDS-hole should boycott but never will So your  organization has decided to boycott all products and services from  Israel. Here is a list of activities that you now need to perform in  order to comply with this boycott.
First,  remove all Intel Pentium and Celeron computer processor chips from  personal computers (desktops, laptops and notebooks) as these were  either developed or manufactured in Israel.
Note that the  revolutionary new Ivy Bridge processor will be manufactured in  Israel. Any computers running the Windows XT operating system must be  turned off immediately as this was developed in Israel. All current  Microsoft operating systems are not to be used as Microsoft is heavily  reliant on its Israel R&D centre.
**Step 2**.  Any computers that still work need to have their anti-virus software  and personal firewalls removed as this technology originated in Israel.  The organisation's firewall will also need to be switched off. Staff  should no longer open external emails as most of these will be infected  with viruses. No outgoing emails can be sent. The algorithm (code)  that's used today for sending e-mails, was made by an Israeli who worked  at the Ben-Gurion University in Be'er-Sheva in 1980.
**Step 3**.  Discard all mobile phones, as this technology was developed in Israel,  where the first mobile phones were manufactured. Mobile chip technology  from a single Israeli company has now been installed in over 100 million  devices. Only top-level staff may retain mobile phones for emergency  situations. However the use of SMS (Texting) is expressly forbidden as  this facility was developed in Israel. No 4G devices can be used, as the  chipset is Israeli.
**Step 4**. Turn off  your voice-mail service and delete any recorded messages. Israeli  companies invented the voice-mail system. If someone you do not know  answers your phone-call, then hang up. Israeli call-centres and  call-centre technology is in widespread operation in the UK.
**Step 5**.  Before accepting any printed material, check that the supplier has not  used the Israeli device that might have saved up to 50% of the ink used.
**Step 6**.  At home, do not use Facebook as many in-built and add-on applications  are Israeli-developed. Do not watch videos on the Internet as the  platform used to upload them may be from AOL and hence from an Israeli  company. Do not use the Internet to search for answers to your questions  as this may involve use of an Israeli-developed search engine. Better  to remain unenlightened.
**Step 7**. On your  TV or home entertainment centre, do not use Video On Demand (VOD) to  watch movies as you may inadvertently see an advert displayed  using Israeli software. Do not purchase any games devices as these are  likely to use Israeli technology.
**Step 8**.  Do not read books using an e-book as this may contain Israeli  technology. Do not use data storage as it may have been developed at  Israel's storage technology R&D center.
**Step 9**.  Do not buy an electric car as it is likely to be powered with  an Israeli battery or use Israeli developed charging mats. Continue to  sit in traffic knowing that you are polluting the environment and  financing oil-rich despotic regimes.
Turning to  food and drink, all food outlets on the organisation's premises must  dispose of cherry tomatoes, which were developed in Israel. Staff must  ensure that no cherry tomatoes are included in sandwiches brought into  office premises. The ban also applies to honey and any products derived  from honey. Israel has developed solutions to the worldwide problem of  bee-colony collapse, so that any products derived from bees might only  be available now due to an Israeli invention.
Avoid  drinking any of the world-recognized award-winning Israeli wines. Do not  consume homemade drinks from Israeli-manufactured household drinks  machines.
Avoid any fruit from South Africa or Peru as produce from these countries is being marketed with Israeli brand names.
No  agricultural products from the following areas must be consumed as they  use water irrigation and agricultural technology provided directly from  Israel. This includes most of Africa, China, India, Indonesia (a Muslim  country), Nepal and many others.
Much fruit and  vegetables (including organic) imported into the UK has been enhanced  using Israeli technology. This may save millions of people from starving  around the world, but is not a good reason for you to eat it. To be  safe, only eat fruit and vegetables that you have grown yourself using  seeds that have been in your family for generations.
Destroy  all personal medication. Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals, the largest  generic drugs company in the world, will have manufactured many of your  medicines.  Staff with the following illnesses will need to take  specific precautions.
Cancer – do not take any form of  medication or treatment. Israeli scientists have been working at the  forefront of oncology for decades.
AIDS and HIV – beware;  researchers at Israel's Weizmann Institute or Hebrew University  developed or improved AZT and Hypericin-based drugs; they have also  developed a treatment that destroys HIV-infected cells without damaging  healthy ones.
Diabetes – do not measure or inject Insulin using the devices developed by Israeli scientists.
Multiple  Sclerosis – stop taking Copaxone, one of the most efficient medicines  and the only non-interferon agent, as Teva developed it.  Don't  touch Laquinimod either.
Parkinson's – remove the  Israel-pioneered brain pacemaker to stop tremors. Discontinue Levodopa,  which reduces motor disturbances. Cease sessions that involve magnetic  cortex stimulation.
Staff with a family history of heart  disease and arteriosclerosis must not use the Israeli device for early  detection of these.  Rather, wait until onset of the disease.
Epileptics  – stop treatment that may have benefited from the Israeli discovery of  the underlying mutant gene; also throw away the bracelet that sends out  an alert when a person goes into seizure.
Staff or relatives with Age-related Macular Degeneration – remove Israeli implants that arrest the disease.
Liver disease – abandon Israeli-developed antibody immunotherapy treatments.
Emphysema – steer clear of the Israeli protein replacement therapy.
Myeloma – stop taking the drug Velcade, which was developed over a period of 30 years by scientists at Haifa.
Sleep apnea – no tests using the breakthrough Israeli device for diagnosis.
Dyslexics must not benefit from the Israeli Internet-based reading system.
Skin allergies must be treated with steroid creams only, as the new safer non-steroid alternative is Israeli.
Any  incident of stroke or head trauma or onset of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,  MS, epilepsy, glaucoma or brain tumor must avoid using any of the  Weizmann Institute's patented methods of treatment.
Before  any surgery or medical tests, check that hospital catheters have not  been protected from infection using the new plastic from Israel that  disables microorganisms. Avoid throat surgery as this may utilize  Israeli surgical lasers.
Ensure any colonoscopy or gastro  investigation does not use internal Israeli cameras such as the  Pillcam.  Never undergo surgery to install an artificial heart, as the  first artificial heart transplant took place in Israel.
Kidney  transplant patients must wait for donors of the same blood group as  only Israel's revolutionary new methods allow donors from other blood  groups.  Staff of Arab origin must not make use of the only database for  matching potential Arab donors of bone-marrow – in Israel.
In  the event of a spinal injury or disease, do not accept spinal  implants – likely to be an Israeli product or development. Heart rhythm  problems must not be solved with the Israeli-developed heart pulse  generator. All heart stents are off-limits as most of these originate  from Israeli medical companies.
Check all vaccines as many  of these have been developed in Israel.  Ensure that all X-rays do  carry a radiation risk, as the only radiation-free system is  Israeli.  Treatments derived from Stem Cell research must be avoided  as most of these are Israeli-developed.
If you or your  family are struck with a bacterial infection, do not take alternatives  to older, ineffective bacteria-resistant antibiotics, as an  Israeli discovery will have been responsible for the modern, effective  drugs. Check that any pain relief medication is not based on soya as an  Israeli doctor discovered the beneficial effect of the soya bean.
Do  not use the revolutionary new Israeli bandage that saved the life of  Arizona senator Gabriella Giffords after she was shot in the head.  If  you break a bone badly, reject any treatment that involves introducing  collagen, as this may have been manufactured from Israeli plants.
Do not protect babies and infants from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome with the Babysense system from Israel.
Do not use Epilady (or epilator) – two Israelis invented this hair removal device.
Finally, reject all major dental treatment, as your teeth may need to be scanned with an Israeli-developed dental scanner.
When  interviewing prospective new staff or holding meetings with members of  the public or with individuals from other companies, it is vital that  you check whether they originate from, or are associated with the  following countries and areas. You must ensure that you do not have any  contact with people who have benefited from Israel's aid to those  countries. The organization must avoid any possible acknowledgment of  Israel's contribution to world relief.   In addition, you must obtain a  formal statement from the government of these countries that Israeli aid  was not responsible for the production or development of any goods and  services supplied to the organization.

Central America (Israel sent emergency medical aid teams and equipment to help victims of Hurricane Mitch in 1998)
Pakistan (2005) and Peru (2007) both accepted aid from Israeli NGOs following earthquake disasters.
Peru's hydro-electric power plants are also being built and run by an Israeli company.
Rawanda, Mexico, Chad,  Sudan (Darfur) and Malawi all have received humanitarian aid from  Israel, including medical assistance from Israel's NGO IsraAID.
Always  remember that the boycott extends to any individuals from the above  regions that have been exposed to Israeli assistance during the 63 years  existence of the current Jewish State.
\-Reject  all products from the USA. Analysis conducted in a typical US  stateshows that Israeli innovations were responsible for $2.4 billion in  direct revenue to that state's economy in 2009 and generated nearly  6,000 jobs.
\-Do not tutor your children in advanced  Mathematics techniques, which may have originated in Israel. Also, if  these techniques are used in your children's schools, withdraw your  children immediately.
\-Keen ornithologists should consider  giving up their hobby as many rarespecies stop off or reside in Israel  during their twice-yearly migration.
\-Do not watch the new series of NCIS as one of the actresses is Israeli.
\-Avoid going to any football matches featuring teams with Israeli players.
\-Destroy  all your recordings of Madonna, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Deep  Purple, Bon Jovie, Justin Bieber, George Benson, Moby and many, many  more artists who have ridiculed the illogical boycott and have proudly  performed (or will shortly perform) concerts in Israel.
\-Destroy  any recordings of U2, Lady Gaga, Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, Beck,  Rihanna Coldplay and any artist whose music has been recorded using  the sound technology of the Grammy Award winning Israeli company Wave  Audio. You also must get rid of any personal copies of *Shrek*,*American Beauty* and *Star Wars*. Do not trust anything recorded by Sony, JVC, Toshiba or Dell.
\-Don't go to see *The Black Swan* with Natalie Portman, or watch any old films with Elizabeth Taylor – both lovers of the Jewish State.
\-Do not stay in hotels or visit shopping centers owned by Israeli companies (sorry, you will need to check which ones yourself).
\-Do not have anything to do with the banks who are using Israeli software to prevent fraud.
\-Do  not use any credit or debit card as the Security monitoring system used  by the credit card companies is likely to be Israeli.
\-Do not buy an engagement ring containing a diamond as it is possible that this may have been cut in Israel.
\-Do not travel by air, as your plane might get towed by the Israeli-built "Taxibot."
\-Do not use public transport inside Amsterdam, Moscow or Northern Chinain case you benefit from Israeli transportation devices.
\-If  you suffer a power or network failure, be grateful that at least you  haven't installed the Israeli system that prevents power outages.
\-Finally,  you need to leave all your taps running when you leave home and must  never flush your  toilet, because Israel provides water-saving technology to over half of  the planet. It also is providing sewage treatment technology across the  world, including to the UK. It should be obvious by now that all the  measures specified in Parts 1 – 4 of this series of blogs will  inevitably mean that your organization and your staff will be completely  unable to function.  Let's therefore hope that the decision by your  organization to boycott Israeli products is flushed down the toilet of  history.

NESTLE
Swiss food giant Nestle will set up a   global research and development center for snack foods next year in   Sderot, a town in Israel's Negev desert, the Maariv newspaper reported   on Sunday. Nestle owns 50.1 percent of Israeli food maker Osem   Investments and the two together produce snack foods at a plant in   Sderot.
DISNEY
The Disney Company is owned by Jewish  Mogul  Michael Eisner. He owns a vast media empire that includes the  ABC  television network, numerous news dailies, national magazines,  Hollywood  film companies and a large number of radio stations. One  radio station  in Los Angeles, KABC 790 AM recently broadcast comments  by Jewess Gloria  Alred to the effect that the Islamic prisoners at  Guantanamo should be  tortured by having their "balls" extracted with  pliers in order to make  them talk. The news and commentaries made  through Michael Eisner's media  octopus are extremely Islamophobic and  anti-Palestinian.

My wife and I (M42) have been married for 2 years together for 15.
All this time we had either not decided to have kids or had problems getting pregnant. After some medical testing we found out that it was near impossible to get pregnant due to some medical issues with her.
We were thinking of adopting when one day she came home and told me she was expecting. Ofcourse I was super happy . 
A week later we had an appointment at the gyno and she had some blood drawn. The test came back negative and ofcourse I was devastated but she wasn't. She claimed that she was pregnant and that the doctor was wrong. We took some more store-bought ones and they all came back negative. My wife is in complete denial. Now she claims we are having twins. She is buying them clothes and decorations and is pressuring me to start with the nursery.

Allegedly, they took over a police station and went after civilians in shelters. Reports of large numbers of civilian casualties and some kidnappings have begun to appear as well.
The commander of Hamas has called for Israeli Arab civilians (20% of the country) to rise up in armed rebellion and is also asking for support from Israel's Arab neighbor states.
 
Meanwhile, Israel has declared a state of war, called up their reserves, and begun a massive bombing campaign in Gaza. This is the most significant attack on the Israeli homeland in 50 years. Given the current government, I would expect an overwhelming response in Gaza, with boots on the ground not out of the question.</td><td>0.6617830257843615</td><td>-0.0752137164073791</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: red"><td>Mom looks at her, lowers her voice and simply says: I got the shivers.</td><td>They can technically still get your IP address, but *that doesn't matter*.</td><td>Momma Suuurley VS JYMOM I've had a bunch of people ask me why Momma Suuurley (MS) was so intimidated by my mother. Well, there is a reason for that. A very good reason. 
JYMOM and MS didn't really meet until our wedding and didn't talk much there. Afterwards, they had no real extended interactions until the birth of oldest LO. 
MS has a daughter but always assumed she would be in the room when oldest LO was born. I told her *no*. DH told her *no*. JYSIL told her *no*. But, sure enough, when it was go-time, I found myself in the hospital room with DH hugging my face, my mother stepping out to get the nurse and MS parked on the fucking couch. The baby nurse came in and asked if she was staying and she says *yes* at the exact time DH and I said *no* in unison. The nurse pretended not to hear and went on about her business. 
DH didn't have a spine at this time, so he just held my hand tighter and told me it was going to be ok. I started to cry just as JYMOM walked in the room. 
MS, decked out in her Sunday best, legit crossed her legs and smirked at all of us. Another nurse walked in and reminded our group that only two people were allowed in, but MS didn't move. 
Not until JYMOM spoke up, that is. 
Mom looks at her, lowers her voice and simply says:
I got the shivers. Room got cold as ice. DH retreated even more into rubbing my hand and the nurses, visibly shook worked to keep themselves busy. MS looked like she wanted to say something, but the stare down she was receiving will go down in history. So save face, she kinda just glided up out of the couch and out the door without a peep. 
That was the first time she tried my mom. 
The second time was at oldest LO's first birthday party. I wanted a small get together at my house. She complained about not being able to invite a bunch of her friends that we didn't know. She complained it was too far (at the time, we lived closer to her than her daughter did). She complained about the colors. In other words, I could do nothing right. But, most of all, she complained about how she couldn't believe he was turning 1 and how he had never spent the night at herrrr house!
So anyway, party day. Keep in mind, I didn't know this happened until my mom told me after it was all over. I was playing with LO and talking to everyone most of the day anyway. Afterwards, while mom and I were cleaning, she told me that MS tried to corner her about how much time she got to spend with oldest LO. Apparently, MS assumed that my mom has him
overnight all the time, even though we had told MS nobody kept him overnight. What MS didn't know was that my mom already knew about all of this (because we are close) and that my mom also doesn't like anyone messing with her daughter. Of course, I'm paraphrasing, but it went something like this:
MS: you must be so excited since you get to keep LO all the time!
Mom: I *visit* LO when my daughter wants me to, I don't keep LO. 
MS: oh, I'm suuuure you get to keep him! She's never let me have a sleepover with him. 
Mom: no, I don't. But, you already know that because it's something my daughter has already told you. 
MS: are you calling me a liar right now?
Since then, the air has always been chilly around those two, but MS seems to get the point that my mom is not one to be played with.
Edit: Mom has always been the community momma. I have so many surrogate brothers and sisters that it isn't funny!
Something else awesome about her: she gets along with everyone. She encourages boundaries (even putting herself aside to make sure we have them), is never demanding or overbearing and is always kind. My brother had been married and divorced three times (I know), but all of his ex wives still refer to my mom as "Momma" and frequent her house or frequently call just to check in. She's the type of mother I want to be, the type of MIL I want to be. And, I need some of her audacity!</td><td>Trust me: the internet knows your IP address. The internet *must* know your IP address, in order for it to be able to send you the data that you request when you pull up a web page or fetch your email. If the internet *didn't* know your IP address, you won't get any cat videos.
Furthermore, "your" IP address *doesn't belong to you*, plus it changes periodically. It belongs to the ISP that you get your internet service from; they just lease it out to you.
So, what you want to do is use a dynamic DNS service, or DDNS, something like No-IP or Dyn. You'll set up an account with one of those services, pick a domain name, then run a small program on your server which will update that domain name with the IP address currently assigned to your router (it's likely that your router has the capability built into it, so you wouldn't need to install anything anywhere else). Also, forward the ports in your router necessary for them to connect to your Minecraft server.
Now, you just tell your Minecraft friends to connect to your server at myminecraftserver.dynamicdnsservice.tld (don't use that, because it's fake; replace it with your actual dynamic domain name). They can technically still get your IP address, but *that doesn't matter*. And at this point, all they could do with the IP address is exactly what they can do with your DDNS domain name: connect to your Minecraft server, and maybe run a port scan, which at this point would only show the Minecraft server.
BTW, having an IP address *does not* give anyone your exact location. The *best* it can do is show that you use a specific ISP and are located somewhere within a couple hundred square miles of the address on record for that ISP's local office. And for some ISPs, they don't associate IP addresses with specific office locations, so your IP address might locate you to a spot thousands of miles away from your actual geographical location, i.e. the headquarters office of the ISP.</td><td>0.6617831497459421</td><td>-0.0356852278547643</td><td>2</td></tr>

So 1 day off every 3 months. None of us in the office get ANY benefits. No PTO, no medical, no holidays, nothing. We were also told that because we (the hygienists) are booked out so far that when we take our day off we will have to come in early or work late to make up for the patients we didn't see that day.
Me and the other hygienists all put in our letters of resignation today. We all typed letters and laid them on his desk. So he got back from lunch and had to read through all the letters. My coworker told me that she saw him throw our stack of letters at the office manager while saying "look at this."
Fortunately hygienists are in crazy high demand in CA right now and all of us already have other job offers.
Tl;dr - boss tries to control our unpaid time off and vastly overestimates his worth. Winds up losing his whole clinical staff.
Update since this blew up: for everyone that's calling BS, I posted my resignation letter and screen shots of texts in the comments. I had one prepared already but I made another one at lunch and printed it out because I felt like I needed to specify that I was quitting because of the policy on unpaid overtime. And yes I did print it out at work lol. 
Update 2: my boss decided to act like nothing happened. He didn't mention anything or even say a word about it to me and the other staff members that were quitting. My coworker did see him toss the resignation letters at our office manager and say "look at this..."
The doctor and my office manager were also in a meeting by themselves at 5pm. He always leaves at around 330 so it was satisfying to see him staying late to sort this out. They both gave me a death stare when I walked by the little window to the room they were in though.

A little backstory, although not much is necessary, we're a typical couple (or we where)
We've been married for 5 years, both of indian descent, with dark skin to match.
we met in our workplace where we both still work together and have been (for the most part) happy ever since.
Things have been a little harder the last few years, we'd been trying for a baby for so long and started losing our hope. So when we finally got pregnant with a healthy baby boy, we where over the moon, my husband could not have been more excited to be a dad.
I'm avoiding it but, might as well cut to the chase, my baby is white. At first i didn't even really notice it, he was more red than anything, but once i saw it was like my brain split open right there in the hospital.
I can't entirly recall what happened, but my husband started screaming at me and i didnt even know what to say. of course i never cheated on him, but clear as day the baby is white! He stormed out pretty soon after, and has been at his brothers place ever since. i only know this because his brother texted me.
its been two days, he hasn't talked to me and I'm afraid to reach out, because i have nothing to even say. i understand why hes so angry, but it hurts that he would think I'd cheat, i cant help to be angry too.
I haven't been able to barley touch my baby, just looking at him makes me cry, its not his poor little fault but who's is? I'm not really a drinker, but i went to a couple events around the time i got pregnant, still i can't remember any moment i could have been drugged. did somone break into my house?
what if i never find out and my marriage is destroyed, if i can't fix this i don't know how i can take care of my son, i can't even look at him.
what do i do once i have to go back to work with him? Will i have to quit?

We loved the location of our hotel (Dauphine Orleans) since we could retreat and cool down whenever we needed to. The one downside was the drivers who revved their engines all hours of the night, but it is what it is. 
We at ate Brennan's, Commander's Palace, Cafe Beignet, apps at Latitude 29 and Arnaud's French 75 bar, Antoine's, NOLA Po Boys, Coop's Place (our favorite, more below), Cafe Du Monde, Acme Oyster House, Galatoire's, and Johnny's Po-boys the morning we left. All were perfect, but Coop's was our favorite because it tasted like it was made by a family at home, and they have a surprisingly amazing scotch selection. We already want to go back there, Arnaud's to have a full meal, and Commander's Palace. There are so many other places we want to visit, we're already planning on returning soon. 
For music, we went to Fritzel's European Jazz pub multiple times since it was close and had no cover. For our next visit, I want to go to Preservation Hall every night, what an experience!We also loved The Spotted Cat on Frenchmen street, which was wonderful except some other patrons were FUBAR and thought they were part of the band too. The performing band stopped once and the drunks got the message. Everyone we saw was so talented! 
We had so much fun reading about the history at each venue, including the old Absinthe House and Lafitte's Blacksmith Bar which I didn't mention above. I have lived in the Midwest, Florida, and California (LA) and none of them can hold a candle to the pride NOLA has in its history. 
Everyone (patrons and employees) we met at the stores, restaurants, and music venues were so nice, we can't wait to meet more next time when the temperature is hopefully cooler and the crawdads are back in season. 
Pro tips for other travelers:
Tennis shoes, any close toed shoe is your friend in the FQ. Streets are uneven and you don't know if that puddle is water, booze, or something else. 
We took aspirin every night and it saved us from having hangovers. 
Drinking lots of water will also help with hangovers and bloating from all the amazing food. 
Talk to people whether they are other visitors, locals, or employees of establishments. We got lucky and met some very kind, fun people during our stay. Southern hospitality is on a whole other level in NOLA. 
If you like partying in clubs, go to Bourbon Street. If you don't, don't go. We used it in a safety in numbers manner while walking from spot to spot at night. A few good spots are on Bourbon, I'm just old now . 
Finally, do your research, have some form of a plan, but leave time for improvisation or chilling out.

Early 20th century eastern America had privatized fire brigades. You would pay your respective firehouse, and hope that they were the fastest at showing up to your house when it was on fire. This led to a lot of houses being burned to the ground with fire crews standing by watching since they weren't the crew hired for that house. Does that sound better than a universal response?

I posted the following, rational response and had it censored. 
"This phraseology "climate change denier", is not only inaccurate, it is insulting. Nobody seriously denies that the climate is warming and nobody calls themselves a "climate change denier". That is a label given to people who are skeptical of the claims of doom and gloom made by the eco-warriors.
What is a matter of debate is whether the change is man-made and whether it is something to be alarmed about. Despite what some would have you believe, science is never settled and there are legitimate scientific reasons to question the consensus that the climate's change is anthropogenic in nature and that a crisis is imminent if not already happening.
There was a time when Eugenics was the consensus best way to improve humanity. Science is not done by consensus and skepticism is a fundamental part of science.
Using the word denier is not only inaccurate for the reason mentioned before, it is insulting because it tries to attribute the same negative feelings associated with holocaust deniers.
"The world is literally a greener place than it was 20 years ago." This according to NASA. Worldwide, poverty is at all time lows. America—a large, high-tech country that accounts for about 25% of the global economy—is now generally using less of most resources year after year, even as its economy and population continue to grow. What's more, the US is polluting the air and water less, emitting fewer greenhouse gases, and replenishing endangered animal populations.
The bottom line is that the climate change hysteria is not a science-based movement. It is a political movement. Scientist don't call skeptics of their science "Heretics". That is more the language of a religion than it is of science."

Due process means that you are allowed to face your accuser in court and plead your case to defend yourself. ERPO hearings are usually held without the accused even being notified, much less allowed to present a defense or cross-examine the person accusing you.

The only requirement is that someone else believes you might commit a crime - harming yourself or others. This opens the door to other similar laws, where you could have your computer confiscated if someone believes you might start cyber bullying or spreading false news for example. It's impossible for the punishment to ***NOT*** be cruel and unusual when no crime has been committed in the first place.
Ignoring the gun debate entirely, red flag laws still set a dangerous precedent that people can be "convicted" and punished while never being arrested, never knowing the charges against them until it's already decided, and never setting foot in a court of law to defend themselves.
EDIT: More sources on specific red flag laws for various states

Not saying whether that's true or not, but Canada's system is far from perfect. In the 2019 Canadian election, the conservative party received the most votes of any party but got fewer seats than the liberals and did not get to form a government. Conservatives received 34% of the vote compared to 33% for the liberals. However, liberals got 46% of the seats compared to 36% for the conservatives.
Of course, that's how the system works. But that doesn't stop people from complaining about the popular vote in the US in 2016.</td><td>0.6992049074257194</td><td>0.09894454680984</td><td>3</td></tr>

Girls are scandalous (guys too, I just don't date guys obviously.)</td><td>The idea that "Democrats are conservatives in Europe" is a Reddit meme that is at best half true. Some aspects of the role of government are just different in Europe, and that's fine. In particular, both the employer-employee relationship (limits on hours, rules about wages, required time off, etc.) and healthcare systems are just different as a norm. It's not so much that the conservatives in Europe don't support privatizing health insurance, as much as it is that this just isn't a political position that is discussed. Some of this is just cultural. For example, a policy to only allow government communications, schools, and businesses in the dominant language would be called "racist" by the American left, but is accepted in France. 
However, there are many mainstream positions in Europe that are far closer to the American right in other issues. You already mentioned immigration. European taxes are less progressive than American taxes but the Democrats want to tax the rich even more (in fact, as measured by how much tax the rich pay, the US has the most progressive tax system in the OECD). Countries like Sweden have privatized pensions and what we would call school choice, where parents can direct government money to private schools instead of public ones. 
Many Democrats in the US support positions that are left of Europe, such as wealth taxes, apportioning government benefits based on race, outlawing gas cars, or disfavoring merit-based immigration.
In reality, the cultures are just different. Europeans prefer a larger government in general, which is fine. But it's not as simple as saying that Republicans are off the chart to the right in Europe on all issues.</td><td>0.6992054525982695</td><td>-0.1607049129188169</td><td>3</td></tr>

We have collapsed core design in the network. Access switches connect directly to the core switch. 
We have three vlans , vlan 1 is data, vlan 2 is wireless, vlan 3 is video. 
We want to enable multicast in vlan 3 only. From my research i learned that: 
1. IGMP snooping is enabled by default for all vlans on Cisco switch and if the vlan isn't spanning multiple switches then multicast will work fine if the sender and receiver are on same switch.
2. If the vlan is spanning across multiple switches then i need IGMP querier or i have to put vlan3 SVI into pim sparse-mode so that it handles igmp join and report across multiple switches and mark required ports as mrouter ports. 
q1. now my question is if I enable ip pim sparse-mode on the SVI for video vlan 3 (SVI resides on core switch in VSS mode) then would it leak multicast to other VLANS? 
q2. Or the leak would happens only when i enable pim sparse-mode on both SVI for vlan 3 (video vlan) and vlan 1 (data vlan)? 
q3. or would it be better that instead of enabling SVI for vlan 3 on core switch for pim sparse-mode i should create another SVI for vlan 3 on the access switch in that vlan and make it IGMP querier?
q4. if all the SVI for multiple vlans reside on the same switch and we enable ip pim on all the SVIs in that case layer 3 multicast work or we still have to enable ip mrouting on that switch? What i understand is we only have to enable ip mrouting if multicast is spanning 2 routers or 2 layer 3 switches. Please correct me.</td><td>Yes, if that is the consensus.

Downstate a bit, in Bloomington-Normal, I got fucked by Maurer Wrecker Services. I was a security guard and was assigned to an apartment complex that had two buildings on either side of a parking lot. One of the buildings had businesses on the ground floor, and the businesses owned the parking lot between the buildings. Nobody could park there after 10:00pm except for security. 
When I was first assigned to that site, I was told which spot to park in and to leave a sign in my back window with the company logo and "SECURITY --- DO NOT TOW". My company called the towing company and told them I would be working the property, would park in that spot, and gave them the make, model, color, and license plate number of my truck. 
Everything is fine for the first two weeks. Occasionally I see the tow truck pull into the lot at 9:59, wait a minute, and then tow any car in the lot at exactly 10:00. One night, halfway through my shift, my truck is gone. I panic, obviously. But then I get a sinking feeling and look up the towing company's number. 
"Hi, did you guys tow a white dodge ram with the license number [license]? From [Apartment Complex Address]?"
"Yeah, I'm the security guard for the property. That's my truck. You knew this. Bring it back."
"Let me get my supervisor"
The company refused to return my truck unless I paid $180 for the towing fee. I called the owner of my company and had them call the towing company. The owner ended up having to pay $150 to get me my truck back. From that point on, I made a point of always being outside when the towing company was there and very obviously writing down notes while staring at them. The two tow guys actually came over one day and confronted my, telling me to "stop fucking writing down what [we're] doing". I told them it was my job to investigate and make a report of suspicious activity and to have a nice night.

I got the Mirena IUD in October last year because I wanted a more hands off approach to birth control. My cycle gets thrown off when I travel to a different time zone, or simply forgot to take it at the normal time, even by a matter of hours. 
Last November I also started my dream job one of the top companies in my industry. It's a corporate company, which has been new for me, but I felt ready for anything it could throw at me. The job has been hard, but I have loved every minute. 
The first few months of having mirena were fine. My cramps felt more sharp, and there was an increase of pimples, but I didn't have to remember to take a pill every day at the same time. 
Last month during my period, I felt like I was sinking with an anchor tied to my leg. I would receive constructive criticism at work and then feel like I was punched in the gut, which never really has been an issue with me. I would sob over small matters. I cried more in the last month than the last few years put together. My confidence was close to zero. I was paranoid that everyone thought I was a wreck. Everything, even taking a shower, felt like a chore. 
This was during the time that Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain committed suicide. In the wake of that, I decided to reach out for help. I started by calling my health insurance company to see if there was any chance it could be my birth control. They said it wan possible, but encouraged me to speak to a mental health professional before changing my BC method. I talked to our on-site company doctor, they too encouraged me to speak to someone and prescribed me seven doses of an anti-anxiety pill. 
Turns out all mental health professionals that my insurance covered weren't close to where I live or work. Thanks, Kaiser Permanente! So getting mental help seemed like it would only another stress factor in life. 
I finally got an appointment with my OBGYN, and he confirmed that he had patients who had symptoms like mine. To know I wasn't going crazy was a huge relief. I decided to wait to remove the IUD, maybe it was just a one-off. Every month priority had been fine. 
As my cycle ended, my personality started to come back. It wasn't over night, it took a week or so. Things were good. 
My period has started again. I've felt ok, but I also got news that I may have to look for a new job in a few months, since our project will be ending and I was not selected to roll over to another project. That has dragged me down again. I hate that I feel like this, but can't wallow because I need to find work.  
I made another appointment to remove my IUD. I had hard times before, but I was never this low for so long. I don't want to others to worry about me. I can't live like this any more. I'll take a pill every day and throw off my cycle rather than sob and wish to hide from the world. 
TL; DR: switched to Mirena. First few months were ok. Seven months later depression and helplessness have taken over, as well as stress from corporate job. Mirena will be removed after second month of feeling this way. Take charge of your health.</td><td>0.699211860265409</td><td>0.0273038917169105</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: red"><td>I am already dead inside, so nothing they say can affect me the slightest.</td><td>Someone in the IT department decided to have a little fun with my name, though, and changed the pattern just for me to use only the first *4* characters of my last name.</td><td>"You sound like a robot" In my last post I mentioned a wide ranging problem that affected most of our customers tv's (we are an ISP that provides Internet, TV and landline telephones). The error lasted for a total of four days before we found the error and fixed it. My last story was about a customer I had during the error who really didn't like the idea that I couldn't magically bring his tv back. This story is about a customer I had shortly after.
This one isn't as detailed, because I didn't start writing it down until a couple of days after.
The call started with the customer telling me he still had the error code problem, and asked why it wasn't fixed yet. I inform him that I haven't heard anything about it today, but if he is ok with being put on hold I can call over to the relevant department and check the status. He grumpily said ok.
I called over and was told that it was solved during the night. If there is still a problem we should troubleshoot as usual. Got it. I return to the customer to inform him about this."Ok, it seems like the large scale issue is solved, so if there is still a problem we need to..."That's how far I got before he interrupted me. He started screaming at me that I was a complete moron who clearly didn't know \*\*\*\* about my job. How could I possibly claim it was solved, when his tv still displayed the error code?
After he calmed down I continued "... If there still is a problem it is caused by *something else* and we need to troubleshoot to find out what."According to the guy, troubleshooting was pointless because there was nothing wrong with his equipment. I should just send a technician. I calmly explain that I can send a technician if he wants to. But if I do that, and the error is something on the customers side, the customer will have to *pay* for the technician.  And besides, there is like a three day waiting time for any technician ever. You might get one in two days if you are lucky. So *if* can get his tv working right away, isn't that better? Before anyone says we should hire more technicians. We hire the same tech companies as every other ISP in the country. We literally have every single possible technician in the country on hand. We can't hire more.
This was apparently an outrageous statement. And a threat, somehow. He was livid stating that he wasn't going to pay a dime, and he shouldn't have to wait since he had been without a tv for so long. I pointed out that this is exactly *why* we troubleshoot before we send out a technician. To make sure the customer doesn't have to pay. He, again, begrudgingly accepted.
My first question was simply: "Have you rebooted your tv-box at any point since last night?"Cue screaming and insults in line with "of course I have? Do you think I am a \*\*\*\*\*\*\* idiot?" So we spend a good 2 minutes on that instead of him just simply saying "yes" so we can move on.
I continue to look up a few things as he berates me. Insults my intelligence. Accuses me of being bad at my job and blames me for the long queue. In hindsight I wished I had said something like: "Oh you are right, I should start working on that queue." and then hung up.
He then point out that making complaints to me is useless because nothing is going to get done about them anyway. (Then why are you doing it?) I respond that "I can bring his complaints to my boss, however...". Again he cuts me off to tell me that I am *not* going to bring his complaints to my boss. He was right though, I only do that for customers who aren't rude \*\*\*\*\*. His reason for knowing that though, was that *he* once worked tech support. And they never reported complaints to their boss. In other words, he sucked at his job, therefore I must suck too. Once he was done I got to end my sentence: "... However I can't speak for what happens after that since it's then out of my hands." More yelling and insults, all though this time directed at my boss and the company, rather than me. A pleasant change of pace that did not last.
I then had the *audacity* to ask if he could try another Ethernet cable to connect the box to the router."Why the hell would I do that?""Well error code XXX also indicates that there is something wrong with the connection between the tv-box and the router. It's possible that something might be wrong with the cable."
Unfortunately I, as the simpleton I am, I didn't know that Ethernet cables are apparently indestructible. And there can't possibly be something wrong with the cable. When I tried to say that there are several things that can be wrong with a cable, he just got more annoyed. Thus more name calling.
A lot of people asked me on my last post why I don't just hang up on rude customers. I am actually allowed to do it. I'm just really stubborn and always try to get through. I am already dead inside, so nothing they say can affect me the slightest. I usually just zone out and look at reddit or play some chess until they stop to breathe. If I do hang up they are most likely just going to call in again and be even angrier at someone else, and they might not be as resilient as I am.
I remain firm in saying that he should try another cable. He curses, again, and then starts working on something, as I hear more muffled curses. I assume he is changing the cables. Wrong. After a while he says "Are you fixing my tv or not?". I ask if he has connected another cable and he goes of the lid. I am apparently completely useless. Apparently my job isn't to help customers, it's to protect the company, remove all responsibility from them and just blame all faults on the customers. Explaining that removing all possible faults that *can* be on the customers side ensures that the technician is free for the customer was not a good enough of an explanation. Apparently technicians should *always* be free.
During this latest rant I take a look at his router and notice that it hasn't had a factory reset in over 1500 days. We recommend you do one around every 6 months or so. Every year at the least. I suggest a factory reset to the customer. He is still pissed, but slightly less pissed than when I suggested to switch cables. He did have another outburst when I told him that our routers take 15 minutes to reset. As if I made the router. But we have a system where our customers can send a text to a certain number and we call them back at the first possible moment. I inform him of this and send him the relevant information. I tell him to wait 15 minutes and see if the tv is working, if it's not he should use the text message I sent him. He finally accepts my suggestion, but with a caveat.
If this reset doesn't fix the problem, and he needs a technician, like he said at the start. He was going to sue the company for wasting his time. And he was going to ask for me to get fired. I simply responded "Well, let's hope this works then." Before I started the factory reset I sent a command to the tv-box to reboot. No idea if it went through, because the system doesn't tell me that. I then started the factory reset.
The customer then made one final complaint. And believe it or not, it was his dumbest one yet. "You know, you sound like a robot when you talk. You should cheer up a little and be more friendly to customers."
Honestly, if he can yell abuse at me for 40 minutes, and then the worst thing he can say about me is "You sound like a robot". I'd say I am pretty damn good at my job. To maintain neutrality in a situation like that as opposed to telling him stick a router where the sun don't shine. That takes some patience. This guy seemed completely oblivious to why I wasn't in a chipper mood.
My parting words were a short "Really?", and then I finally hung up on him. Never heard from him again. Kept track of his customer ID and checked back two days later. No further logs and no technicians hired. Either the reset did the trick and it works. Or he is currently working on his lawsuit against the company which is totally going to work, and is definitely going to get me fired for following procedure.
In hindsight I really wished I had ended the call by saying "Well, what can I say? Maybe next time you could try to be nice to people who are just trying to help you, instead of being rude and yelling insults constantly. You just might get  different result that way. Have a nice day."
I would definitely have been reported and probably reprimanded for saying that. But it would have been so worth it. Most likely my boss would just have given me a "stern talking to" while actually really understand why I said it.</td><td>I attended a small private college 20+ years ago, and they had a typical pattern for their email addresses, <first initial><first 6 chars of last name><single digit starting at zero>@college.edu.

I tell him that I'll send him some step-by-step instructions via email. I promise I'll phrase them in the easiest way possible and advise that he should try to get someone to help him carry out the instructions (locally).
The instructions include things like how to take a screenshot of any errors, finding a log file etc. etc. and then sending these to us via email.
I don't have much hope, but there's not much I can do and elderly customers aren't super uncommon in our call center. Sometimes you just have to send them written instructions where they can see everything black on white, and then let them experiment on their own.
A day later, the customer phones back, he found one(!) log file but doesn't know how to send us the file.
I spend about half an hour explaining how to attach a file to an email. He's very friendly and apologizes for his incompetence, mentioning that he's 90 years old and that he has had a hard day, coming from chemo and that he doesn't have very long to live, that he just wants to write some letters to his friends and family before he 'leaves' (he phrased it like this).
He then thanked me for my support and told me he'll try sending the file again later because he felt very tired right in that moment. Call ends.
I've had to deal with quite a number of cancer patients in my life, actually, but this guy still managed to find my soft spots.
Next day, I receive an email from him. One file attached (I asked for 4), so I open it up - it's a Word document called  something like "msinfo32letterflyanair", so I guess he tried to save his System Info file but probably messed it up and did something else.
I was right - when I opened it I saw that it's an actual Word document with a letter to a flight company. The letter was basically a request to cancel his flight about half a year down the line as he was to weak to travel and probably wouldn't even make it that long.
Reading that accidentally sent letter, I decided that this guy was THE exception my supervisors always mentioned when we talked about TeamViewer.
I asked about it, actually got the request authorized, and then managed to schedule an appointment for the session with the customer.
I helped him setup TeamViewer, which was another call of about 30mins, and then my supervisor started the remote session. In the meanwhile, I had to stay on the phone with the customer, instructing him on any required steps (supervisor didn't speak the same language).
Supervisor then finds some issues, performs some steps, and lastly performs a reinstall of the customers Office pack. While the installation is running, I figure I should do some small talk with the customer to cover the waiting time. We had built quite a relationship by now, so in between I asked:
Me: "Oh, woah! And you voluntarily agree to a remote session with tech support on that day? \[then, jokingly\] We feel flattered!"
Customer: "Yes, my wife and me figured it's a nice birthday gift, somehow."
Me:  (smiling) "That's one way to see it! Are you doing anything else today or are you taking it easy?"
Customer: "Just having our kids and grandchildren over later. We'll have some cake and coffee and chat a bit. Nothing big."
Me: "That's nice! I also think we're done soon, let me just have a quick look..." \[checking status of reinstall - supervisor just finishing up and giving me a nod\] "Actually, that's us finished now. You can try now if you like. Let's hope you like this present."
Customer:  \*tests his software, everything works\* "This is amazing. Thank you so much. This is the best birthday gift you could ever give me!"
Needless to say, it was a happy day for both him and me. Just had to share this story as I still like to think back and remember it. :)
  
Edit: Thanks, kind giver of platinum award!</td><td>My old boss did something like that a couple years ago. Made some changes on a switch to enable a new IP camera system we were installing, but got some things jacked up, so he rebooted the switch. Unfortunately, there were a bunch of other important configuration elements which had been made previously, but *never copied to the boot configuration*. So when the switch came back up, it was missing a bunch of things that were pretty much mission critical for that section of the plant.
He eventually got it reconfigured to the working setup and then got the IP cameras added successfully, but it took him a couple of days to get it all worked out. Somehow, in all that time since the previous configuration changes had been made, the switch had never gone down, so he had forgotten that the running config had never been saved to the startup config.</td><td>0.6992126861044436</td><td>0.1269171346814546</td><td>3</td></tr>

Long story short, we had a model of laptop that had began overheating, melting and even exploding in extreme cases. As people who worked in this particular sector of call center work would know, when an issue of safety comes up, the employees taking calls are given special instructions on how to quickly make sure CX is okay, then immediately escalate the call to Tier 2. 
Get a call one day from a woman who says her computer is overheating. I immediately ask if she's okay and safe and she assures me she's fine, and there is no present danger. So I proceed to tell her I'll have to escalate the call, I'll just need a little info from the computer. I get the info, put her on hold, and call our Tier 2. After getting the agents name, I patch the call together and begin to introduce the agent to CX. I'm immediately interrupted by the customer yelling "HOLD ON!" followed by some rustling. The Tier 2 agent pauses for a moment before saying "Ma'am are you okay?" More rustling and then a whooshing sound in the background (our headsets are pretty crappy so it was hard to tell what was happening exactly) Few moments later the woman comes back and says "Sorry, had to get the FIRE EXTINGUISHER" Agent immediately asks if we need to call the authorities. Woman proceeds to tell us "No I'm fine, the table was just on FIRE" Agent asks what caused it, CX replies " the computer, it was smoking when I called in, that's why I called, wanted to see if you could fix it OVER THE PHONE" At this point the Tier 2 kicked me from the call to take care of the customer.
TL;DR Customer calls with computer overheating issue, says she's fine, escalate Call, return to patch together, find out computer WAS ON FIRE THE WHOLE TIME</td><td>I dealt with something vagely similar a few years ago. Had a used car dealership with a location in Fairbanks and another in Anchorage, and they wanted to buy websites from us, one per location. An important part of the website was getting the dealer's inventory on the site, including photos of the cars, VIN, features, options, yadda yadda.
Most customers could just send us a CSV export directly from their dealer management system, sometimes tab- or pipe-separated (and occasionally XML, ugh, I hated those) -- no problem, I had loads of existing code to deal with all of that, automated, as long as the export arrived by the time the import ran, Bob's your uncle.
This pair of dealers, however, ran an ADP system, which consisted of some sort of minicomputer running at each location, with a web interface which simply stuck a terminal emulator into a web page, green text and all. But they could export their data as a text file, so they sent it to me to look at.
This was not CSV. It was not tab-separated. It was not pipe-separated. Hell, it wasn't even XML. It was simply grouped lines of text, with control characters embedded (sprinkled about the file liberally). Each group had the same type of information, but it wasn't consistent -- the lines of information were not in the same order from record to record, the installed options were not in any sort of cohesive pattern and didn't consistently use common terms for features, and you might not even get the same number of lines in each record. There were significant issues with this file structure.
So we contacted ADP to see about getting a nice CSV export set up from the dealers. There was already an Excel file export on the web terminal page, so we figured a CSV export would be quick and easy, maybe even a feature that already existed and simply needed turned on.
ADP wanted to charge us fifty thousand dollars for them to write the CSV export.
The final import script I wrote simply extracted the VIN, mileage, and sale price from each record, and hit up our VIN lookup system for the rest.</td><td>0.6992149791842018</td><td>0.0437631810116341</td><td>3</td></tr>

And call back in twoce more to have me explain to them the exact same thing.
Then, this week, they called in to say they'd moved out and they needed the contract cancelling. Well, 'cancelling' is the wrong term, but I can work with them. I inform them of what info to give in to which companies, and that the new owner will be contacted separately.
This makes them unreasonably upset. 'They want it 'just cancelling'. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.
I explain a different way about giving correct legal notice that they've moved out. They again get upset. It is looking like they're not moving out and are just saying this to get out of the contract, but I got there.
And then they call back and we go through this all again.
I point out that I'm *trying* to help, but to get them to the end state they want, I need *accurate* information, as if I do the wrong thing, it won't work.
They eventually admit there is no move out going on, but they do have two contracts. I explain it all again. They seem happy.
They then call back in with their brother. Who explains that they ARE moving out. I explain that process again. They seem happy.
Then, while I'm on the phone with a more... rational customer, they call back in. Five times. Only to not pick up when I get off the phone and call them back.
I'm sure our next call will be super fun.
EDIT: They called back.
They called back with a friend, who was far more helpful to talk to. They claim the business has left the premises, which would end the contract.
Resultantly, our change oftTennancy team contacted the site to speak to the new owners.
Guess what numpty picked up the phone!

TL;DR Rubber Mallet beats expensive door
Oblig. Formatting on mobile and English ain't my mother tongue. Also I suck writing on mobile. 
My Hubby works as a System Admin but this particular story did not actually challenge his technical expertise so much as his sanity and common sense...
For Context he is working at a company that acts as a service provider for other bigger businesses who don't want to pay their own IT or who's own IT is specialised in certain  fields only.
His Boss is one of those people who promise everything and their uncle to the customer and _afterwards_ ask if what he promised is actually, ya know, _available_ 
For a while he got it into his head to sell IT telephones, and everything that could possibly entail. My Hubby, then still a trainee, got two days of prep and was from that day on the 'Expert' on everything Telephone.  I could go on and on how _nothing_ ever worked with telephones, how the customers never had any systems that were in anyway compatible with whatever IT Phone they had bought, how the sales people sold things they didn't have, how one of the Customers is still waiting for completion, a 3/4 Year later... it was an utter disaster.
Anyway, one of the things in tandem with the phones were electronic door openers which could be used via the IT Phone to buzz people in. One Customer wanted the whole brand new office they were just finishing equipt with that.
So, my Hubby packs in all the electronic door keys that are supposed to go into the doors to make them tick and drives of. Once there, he has a floor plan and starts with the first door. He tries to put the Cylinder through the latch into the hole meant for exactly that.  It goes in halfway and no further. He twist, he turns, no dice. When he takes the Cylinder out again to see if something might be in there to block it, he realizes that the hole itself is completely twisted. It skews upward so that he can only see a sliver of light on the other side. Needless to say, ain't no cylinder going in there. 
Well, he thinks, one bad door, I'll write it down and I'll probably have to come back once more, bummer.
In the end he gets one of 12 Cylinder in. None of the doors fit. Whoever build the doors has screwed up royally. Hubby drives back to the Company with fotos and the rest of the devices and tells his boss. His answer? "No, I'm sure those fit. Next time you'll just take my rubber mallet and hammer those things in."
Hubby politely declined, reasoning  that that was _insane_ and would most definitely _not_ make the situation better. 
That was a Friday, on Monday he had to go into his trade school. On Tuesday he comes back to see one of his colleagues filling out a compensation claim from the customer. 
Colleague wasn't as brave in standing up to his boss as hubby had been and actually took the rubber mallet. The first door he tried this foolproof method on was the Door of the Customers Boss, nice wood, with an inlaid plaque. Now it was all that but with a nice chunk missing where the Mallet had struck.
Long story short Hubby's Boss decided to discontinue Phone service.

I quit my job, flipped my LinkedIn status to 'willing to hear from recruiters' flew home and spent a few days catching up with house/motorcycle/dental/car repairs, cat feeding and sleeping on a sopophoric couch.  
  
I log back into LinkedIn to nothing I can take- temp to perm jobs three states away, sales positions and ill-formed "do everything like a senior but pay you like an intern" positions.   
  
I even think about picking up some litigation work, but that smells like failure.  
  
I drop a line to two technical recruiters I like and ask for some contract work to tide me over.  
  
One, who we'll call Burt, calls me back that afternoon.  
  
Burt:"Hey, I saw you were looking for short term work. I have an, er, odd request and you might be interested"    
  
I hear a buzzing sound in the background, but assume it's just noise on the line.
  
  
Burt:"This isn't one of my normal clients. They need to figure out their backups and possibly recover some data. It's urgent, so the faster you can get here, the faster you'll get paid. I'll guarantee that part if you make them happy"  
  
I get a contact, an address and a phone number. I tell Burt I'll be there this afternoon and make my self presentable, collect some tools, then ride out there on my motorcycle.  
  
I arrive, find a place to park and busy my self with getting my suit jacket and laptop bag off the bike while securing my motorcycle gear in my saddlebags.  
  
A middle aged woman has left her beige sedan and is walking towards me with a "I want to talk to your manager" air.  
  
Beige Camry:"Don't you know you'll never amount to anything riding that death machine?"  
  
I'm still fumbling with my remove sunglasses, pull regular glasses from their case, place sunglasses in case, remove helmet, put glasses on my face without dropping anything or poking myself in the eye with the glasses, so I don't pay Beige Camry much attention.  
  
  
Beige Camry:"You won't go to college and you won't make it past 30 doing stupid things"  
  
I'm now paying attention. I'm still confused. I look around to make sure she's addressing me. She is. She's planted her nurse shoe wearing feet and wants to give me both barrels.  
  
me:"I've made it past 30 and graduated college, but I still do stupid things. Thank you for the compliment"  
  
I go back to the stowing and bungee cording while she glares, then walks off, towards a building next to the parking lot.  
  
A few minutes later, I'm respectably wearing a suit jacket with my laptop bag slung over my shoulder looking for my destination.   
  
I find my destination and the appropriate office suite. It turns out to be the Law Offices of Amygdala and Euripides, PC . The receptionist tells me to wait in a waiting room with outdated magazines while I hear the buzz of drills.  
  
A middle aged man introduces himself as Mr Euripides and ushers me back to his cramped office.  
  
Me:"So, I understand you have some problems with backups"  
  
Euripides:"We do. We switched providers and now everything is messed up."  
  
Me:"Ok. By 'service', we're talking a managed service provider- a contractor who handles technical issues, sets up systems and the like'?  
  
Euripides:"Yes. The old one was too expensive. They were charging us rent on a file server, so we terminated the contract. I had my nephew build a new server and connect it to a cheaper backup service"  
  
  
Euripides:" About two weeks ago, we lost all our files on the server and neither of the backups work. Each blames the other and they start talking technobabble. I threatened them with litigation, but that didn't get my files back." 
  
Me:"I think I understand. I speak fluent technobabble. Let me take a look and I'll give you an estimate on the costs"  
  
Euripides:"Burt is taking care of that part"  
  
I'll have to figure out what that means. I'm here, so I should at least take a look. Lawyer hands me a wrinkled sheet of paper and walks me to a louder room. It seems that their IT closet is in a construction zone. There's sheet rock dust, saw dust and a few broken drop-ceiling tiles' worth of detritus on a single open rack.  
  
At the bottom of the rack are two flashy gaming PC towers. Translucent Lucite sides with LED light strips show me a stack of hard drives . Clearly the builder was thinking about a different kind of Enterprise than I was.  
  
I turn to Euripides. 
  
  
Lawyer:"My nephew's number is on that paper. I don't understand all this stuff anyway. Anything else you need from me?"  
  
me:"Let me take a look and I'll call your nephew if I have any questions"  
  
He walks off while I grab a spare keyboard and monitor from an unused cubicle. I plug into the PC on the left and use a password on the sheet to login.  
  
A bit of poking and the OS sees one mountable volume, but four drives. Seems they're some kind of RAID. One drive is showing a hardware failure.  
  
That's odd, but perhaps that's because Windows isn't my strength. I reboot the first PC from a linux USB drive and move my monitor and keyboard to number 2.  
  
This one is a bit happier. I see two volumes mounted. One for the OS, one for file storage.  
  
  
This might be easier than I thought.  
  
I look through the backups and see one per day, going back about a month or two.  
  
I pick one from about two weeks ago. It's compressed, so it's going to take a few minutes. I swap back to the first PC, which has booted linux.  
  
Ok. Four drives. I can mount the OS drive fine. One dead. Remaining two a part of an array. I don't get it. Assuming RAID 5, one drive can fail and we can still read and write data. I need to think on this for a second.  
  
Back to the other PC to see how the restore's coming. That was fast. I open the folder and see a full backup.  
  
Of the operating system. Not the file storage. I check the other backups and they're all the same size. Great.   
  
Then I notice something that makes me sad. The OS volume is 4TB. The Storage volume is 12TB. One drive, three drives.   
  
There's no parity, the drives aren't mirrored. If any one fails, the whole volume fails.   
  
I find Lawyer's nephew's number and call it. I get voicemail. I tell him to call me back.  
  
So my local backups aren't and the one volume that holds the data is borked.  
  
This is going to be complicated. I call Bart, the recruiter who brought me in.  
  
  
me:"Uh, not so well. I have a feeling this is going to be expensive."  
  
  
me:"We might have to ship out three drives for recovery. We're talking a few thousand to start"  
  
  
me:"I don't have a clean room. I might swap a hard drive controller board, but this is magic by comparison."  
  
  
me:"I have one last thing to try, but I'm not feeling lucky. Give me an hour"  
  
  
  
Bart:"Yep. I'll pay you for your time and barter with Euripides"  
  
  
I look at the other number on the paper. It's a local MSP named OnFight. I call the number. After a few minutes in a phone tree inspired by the maze in Zork 1, I exit the twisty passages and get to Joel, a support rep.  
  
Joel:"HithisisJoelatOnFightpleasehold"  
  
  
hold music, occasionally interrupted by short, amateur commercials about how _awesome_ OnFight's service is.  
  
Joel:"HithisisJoelthankyouforwaiting. What'sthecustomernumber?"  
  
me:"I'm trying to reach whomever manages your backups. I don't have a customer number, but the customer is Law Offices of Amygdala and Euripides, PC."  
  
  
me:"Wait wait wait. Can I talk to a manager for five minutes? I think can solve a problem for you all if I can talk to someone who can make a quick decision"  
  
  
The wait isn't as long.  
  
Manager:"Hi there. This is Rebecca. What's this about Amygdala and Euripides?"  
  
me:"Thanks. You used to rent them a server and do their backups, right?"  
  
Rebecca:"That's correct. A few months ago we got told to take the server back and to stop the backups"  
  
me:"Ok, got that. Is there any chance you haven't wiped that server?"  
  
Rebecca:"We overwrote the drive,  reformatted the server and allocated it to a new customer. Backups securely overwritten per A&E's request"  
  
  
Rebecca:"That's correct. We have emails from Euripides' nephew and a signed letter from Euripides himself"  
  
  
I call Nephew again.  
  
  
me:"Hi. This is Lawtechie. I'm trying to figure out your backups"  
  
  
me:"Let me understand. The shiny box on the left is the primary and the one on the right is the backup?"  
  
  
me:"It looks like you're only backing up the C: drive"  
  
  
me:"You're backing up the operating system on a nightly basis"  
  
  
me:"No, that's reinstallable. What about the various documents your uncle's law practice actually runs on?"  
  
  
  
  
me:"There's a lesson every techie learns. If you don't test your backups, you don't have any"  
  
Nephew:"We shouldn't need them. Those disks are RAID"  
  
me:"You sure? It looks like you set them up without mirrors or parity"  
  
  
me:"I think you should learn some things before building systems that people rely on next time"  
  
Nephew:"Yeah. I'm going into cybersecurity soon so that stuff won't matter"  
  
me:"Good for you. That's a business where charlatans and the soulless run rampant. There's also a negative side."  
  
  
me:"Is there any chance there's a full backup anywhere else somewhere?"  
  
  
me:"Tried that. Seems that you told them to burn it all"  
  
  
me:"I wish you luck in your career"  
  
  
I texted Bart to tell him that it wasn't looking good, then I walked to Euripides' office to tell him about hard drive recovery. He thanked me in the way people do when they think you're trying to take advantage of them and said that he'd talk to his nephew before making any important decisions.  
  
Bart paid me for that day and I went home.</td><td>Your mom is a JN, big-time. As others in the comments have said, mom isn't a "soft place to land", she's a concrete pit with metal spikes -- *stay away*. Your husband is trying to protect his new family from one who clearly wants to cause damage to it, if not outright destruction (i.e. your mother). You and hubby are a team now -- stick together no matter what she tries to do. Your husband is revealing his shiny spine and is trying to do his job to protect you from JNMom's machinations -- put on your sunglasses and hang on, cuz it's going to be a helluva ride.
> I feel like she's saying "I know you're going to get divorced one day, but don't worry, I'll be here for you when that happens."
That's *exactly* what she's saying, and even hoping for. Worst case, *she'll try to bring that prophecy to fulfillment* through her manipulations, just to maintain her control over you. She will try to pit you against hubby; *do not fall into the trap*. You say you don't want to rock the boat. It's understandable, but you *need* to flip that boat over and *throw her out of it*. Do everything you and hubby can to get out of her house and into your own place as quickly as possible. You're freaking out and mad at hubby, even though you agree in principle with what he said.  That's what *she* wants, though -- you angry at *him* instead of *her* over what *she* did wrong. *That's the trap*. Let your anger at him subside, because he did what was necessary at the moment. Your husband is not the enemy here; he's your greatest ally. I think you know that, but years of indoctrination from the *real* enemy have you reacting knee-jerk. Suppress the brainwashing and look at it rationally.
Set those boundaries, set clear penalties, and *stick to them*. If you have trouble doing it, let your husband run interference -- it seems like he's already getting into the battle here, and I think he's up to the task. Until you're strong enough to get all the way out of the FOG, let him be the bad guy (as far as mom is concerned), but don't let him do it alone; *stick with him* -- he's going to need your support. Don't let your mom tear the two of you apart.
> EDIT: I did confront her after the rent thing to let her know I thought we had agreed on just utilities, and she did back down, but it was in that moment we realized some weird dynamics were at play.
Excellent! You stood to her up in a relatively simple matter, and *you won*. Let that build some confidence in yourself. You also begin to see how things are going to start playing out, so be prepared for bigger and harder battles. Take it one battle at a time, one day at a time, and let hubby help -- that's one of the things we husbands are there for in our marriages. Don't get complacent -- get ready for the next encounter.
I'll echo what others have already said -- get some counseling to help you clear the FOG. And above all else, *talk with your husband*. He is there for you, just as much as you are there for him. He seems to have the strength you need right now to get clear -- use it, and eventually you will have your own strength and the confidence to use it.
I know that science-fiction is not everyone's cup of tea, and especially not Star Trek. But there's an episode of Deep Space Nine that I think is worth a watch (season 6, episode 7, "You Are Cordially Invited") -- Worf and Jadzia's wedding ceremony in the last few minutes of the episode. I think it shows a picture of what you and your new husband need to be in your current situation -- a united force fighting against all who would destroy you (i.e. your mother and any flying monkeys she sends your way), watching each other's backs, and picking each other up when something knocks you or hubby down. This *will* be a battle, and you need to be ready to fight it. You have already noticed the problems, and you agree with what hubby wrote. You just need the confidence in both him and the two of you together, and the strength to break through a lifetime of mom's programming.</td><td>0.6821027704405754</td><td>0.0087238547670575</td><td>3</td></tr>

And don't forget the fistulas for shits and giggles!</td><td>Your mom is a JN, big-time. As others in the comments have said, mom isn't a "soft place to land", she's a concrete pit with metal spikes -- *stay away*. Your husband is trying to protect his new family from one who clearly wants to cause damage to it, if not outright destruction (i.e. your mother). You and hubby are a team now -- stick together no matter what she tries to do. Your husband is revealing his shiny spine and is trying to do his job to protect you from JNMom's machinations -- put on your sunglasses and hang on, cuz it's going to be a helluva ride.
> I feel like she's saying "I know you're going to get divorced one day, but don't worry, I'll be here for you when that happens."
That's *exactly* what she's saying, and even hoping for. Worst case, *she'll try to bring that prophecy to fulfillment* through her manipulations, just to maintain her control over you. She will try to pit you against hubby; *do not fall into the trap*. You say you don't want to rock the boat. It's understandable, but you *need* to flip that boat over and *throw her out of it*. Do everything you and hubby can to get out of her house and into your own place as quickly as possible. You're freaking out and mad at hubby, even though you agree in principle with what he said.  That's what *she* wants, though -- you angry at *him* instead of *her* over what *she* did wrong. *That's the trap*. Let your anger at him subside, because he did what was necessary at the moment. Your husband is not the enemy here; he's your greatest ally. I think you know that, but years of indoctrination from the *real* enemy have you reacting knee-jerk. Suppress the brainwashing and look at it rationally.
Set those boundaries, set clear penalties, and *stick to them*. If you have trouble doing it, let your husband run interference -- it seems like he's already getting into the battle here, and I think he's up to the task. Until you're strong enough to get all the way out of the FOG, let him be the bad guy (as far as mom is concerned), but don't let him do it alone; *stick with him* -- he's going to need your support. Don't let your mom tear the two of you apart.
> EDIT: I did confront her after the rent thing to let her know I thought we had agreed on just utilities, and she did back down, but it was in that moment we realized some weird dynamics were at play.
Excellent! You stood to her up in a relatively simple matter, and *you won*. Let that build some confidence in yourself. You also begin to see how things are going to start playing out, so be prepared for bigger and harder battles. Take it one battle at a time, one day at a time, and let hubby help -- that's one of the things we husbands are there for in our marriages. Don't get complacent -- get ready for the next encounter.
I'll echo what others have already said -- get some counseling to help you clear the FOG. And above all else, *talk with your husband*. He is there for you, just as much as you are there for him. He seems to have the strength you need right now to get clear -- use it, and eventually you will have your own strength and the confidence to use it.
I know that science-fiction is not everyone's cup of tea, and especially not Star Trek. But there's an episode of Deep Space Nine that I think is worth a watch (season 6, episode 7, "You Are Cordially Invited") -- Worf and Jadzia's wedding ceremony in the last few minutes of the episode. I think it shows a picture of what you and your new husband need to be in your current situation -- a united force fighting against all who would destroy you (i.e. your mother and any flying monkeys she sends your way), watching each other's backs, and picking each other up when something knocks you or hubby down. This *will* be a battle, and you need to be ready to fight it. You have already noticed the problems, and you agree with what hubby wrote. You just need the confidence in both him and the two of you together, and the strength to break through a lifetime of mom's programming.</td><td>0.6821092995208038</td><td>0.2542810871807238</td><td>3</td></tr>

Actually, this isn't surprising at all. When configuring iMail on your iPhone or Laptop, you may notice that security is off by default. So you just go ahead and configure it correctly, right?

Turning it into a felony (5 years statute, which is still expired) requires it to have been done to conceal another crime (possibly a NY State crime), and it's unclear what that crime would be. In addition, it's worth noting that the Biden DOJ and Bragg's predecessor both investigated and declined to prosecute this same set of facts. Finally, tackling the statute of limitations question requires the state to argue that Trump has been out of their prosecutorial jurisdiction due to having been president. 
Every legal analysis I've read suggests that the legal theories behind this prosecution are dicey and novel. This one from Reason summarizes it well. Even the NYT says it "hinge[s] on a largely untested and therefore risky legal theory". I'd be interested if anyone can share an unbiased analysis looking at the legal issues here that concludes this is a solid case.

Oil and whale blubber are not remotely comparable.  Whale blubber was used to read at night.  Our entire civilization runs on oil.  Our relationship to oil is more comparable to the Irish relationship with the potato circa 1844.

"The Market" cannot produce energy, only different ways to harness available energy.  The problem is that we use such a gargantuan quantity of fossil energy it seems there is nothing known to physics that can feasibly replace it.  All the commercially produced biomass in the US could not replace our gasoline consumption.  Uranium and coal are in much shorter supply than is popularly supposed.  As you work your way down the list of ways to replace oil everything comes up way too short.

Aside from the limited potential of substitutes to match current consumption, we also face the problem that as oil reaches price points where the substitutes become viable we will be much poorer and perhaps unable to afford the development investments.

This is entirely incorrect. Most serious climate scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change (ACC) is a real thing. Where the issue lies is  is what is the effect of ACC, how serious or not is it and what, if anything should we do about it.

After the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, the debate on gun control policy has once again resurfaced in the public purview. 
In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine has pushed for the passage of a so-called "Red Flag" law. These are "state laws that authorize courts to issue a special type of protection order, allowing the police to temporarily confiscate firearms from people who are deemed by a judge to be a danger to themselves or to others." An example of a state with a current Red Flag law is Oregon: 
>Oregon's Red Flag law requires a fairly simple process. The first step is for a concerned family member, household member, or law enforcement officer to ask the court for an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO), which will remove a weapon, or a concealed handgun license, from an individual who is at risk for suicide or is a danger to others. An Order also prevents the person from buying additional guns for a one year period. The law is nicknamed "Red Flag Law" for when a person exhibits a 'red flag' or other indicator that they may be a harm to themselves, or others. It is one of the few tools that family and household members have to quickly remove a weapon from somebody who is at risk. 
Other states include Florida and Maryland. However, there has been some issues raised regarding these laws. 
How do these laws interact with the Constitutional right to bear arms and to avail of due process?</td><td>> This whole issue seems to be similar to the defund the police movement.

A martial arts expert ruined by an 11-year-old girl In the sixth grade, I bore witness to a stunning example of malicious compliance.
Several grades of classes from our elementary school were called to the gymnasium for some lessons on self-defence.  We were to be given some very rudimentary examples of how we, as children, can fight off an attacker if there are no other options. The instructor was a man who had a long martial artist title and was unbearably smug about it. Sure, he'd made some big accomplishments, but he would take every moment available to deliver his lengthy champion title verbatim. Damned if I can remember what it was; it might have been a wilful effort on my part to erase it.
He was instructing us on how to basically go belly-up like a distressed turtle and kick off an attacker. We weren't really understanding how this was feasible, and we were asking a lot of questions about it. He got tired of the questions and called up a volunteer to demonstrate the self-defence technique. He called upon Alice, a girl in my class.
He didn't just tell her how to get into position, however. He was putting his hands on her and getting her to lie belly-up on the waxed gymnasium floor in a way that was truly creepy and invasive, even to children who might not understand why. He gave her long stares and made some quiet remarks to her that we couldn't hear, but the expression on her face said, "Yuck." I was only 11 years old, but I got the gist of the situation and thought to myself, "This guy is fucking gross."
She had her legs up to kick, was making kicking motions but clearly swerving away from making direct hits to this man. It wasn't enough for him to just have the kids understand the technique. He needed to demonstrate his martial arts prowess. He said to her, "No, go ahead and fight me. This works on an amateur, but I'm a (insert his lengthy and proud title here)."
He could not have known, but my entire class knew, that Alice was a competitive swimmer. She had swimming skills beyond her years and all the medals and awards to prove it. Complete with the muscular development of someone who has spent years mastering their sport, particularly in her legs.
Alice seized the opportunity to fight off a man who was already throwing up some problematic indicators of his own predatory nature. She kicked him a few times, clipping a shin or a thigh as he artfully dodged her full-on attacks with a big grin on his face.
She then triumphantly planted her sneaker directly into his crotch with a force that made both her and this man red in the face.
He let out a strangled yelp before crumpling to the ground. He dry heaved a few times, too. He was in medical distress and some adults rushed to get him help. To the children, though, we just saw a guy get kicked in the balls by a kid, and that's comedy gold in elementary school. He was helped out of the gymnasium amid the roaring, bellyaching laughter of 100+ children.
Astoundingly enough (to me, at least), Alice was facing punishment for what had happened. Detention was already assigned, suspension was up in the air. Thankfully, Alice's mother rose up with the fury of a thousand women scorned after hearing Alice's testimony of events. Alice faced no suspension, and to my knowledge did not attend any after-school detention sessions. For the rest of the school year, she was recognized as the ultimate badass, and reigning queen of justice-by-testes.
TL;DR: Self defence assembly was called by my school, the instructor was both smug and creepy. He called up Alice to demonstrate a self-defence technique and insisted she fight him off, she crushed his reproductive organs and chaos ensued.
Edit: I understand why anyone who hasn't had the lived experiences of myself nor Alice would doubt my retelling, and it's your prerogative to feel however you want to feel. While it happened, there is little I can do to convince you of that. Please read Rule 3 of this sub before you leap to the opportunity to express as much.

> In an incident from 2012, Gaetz and some of his legislator bros got drunk at a Disney resort and made a loud scene in the lobby. He attempted to bribe the front desk attendant with $20 to get access to another guest's room.
The ultimate source for this is here. It alleges that Gaetz was one of many who were there but the assertion that he is the one who did this seems to be made up by the Medium author.
> However, in this case the arresting officer was forced to resign in lieu of being fired in an "unrelated" matter within a week of Gaetz's arrest. The judge then quietly dismissed all charges. He somehow even avoided the suspended license. It's good to have a dad who's a leading state senator. 
Those scare quotes around "unrelated" and the last sentence certainly read like Gaetz and his Dad got this officer fired to make a problem go away. What does the actual article cited tell us?
> On Nov. 10, Anglin made a DUI arrest in Destin. An internal affairs report said that Anglin grabbed the suspect around the neck after he believed the suspect spit on him. But three other deputies, including a trainee, were there as well, and said the spitting was unintentional and that Anglin used unreasonable force. An internal affairs report agreed.
> According to Anglin's personnel file, this was his fourth infraction, and third in a year.
Now it certainly seems like Gaetz should have been charged and convicted, but it's hard to do that when the arresting officer has been fired for repeated misconduct.
> They recalled one incident of him making jokes about hiring strippers for a Super Bowl party he organized. 
A joke about strippers? Scandalous!
> Two sources, including a Republican state representative who served alongside Gaetz in the Florida House in 2014–15, have accused Matt Gaetz of coming up with a sex game when he served in the state legislature.
I have no idea whether this is true, but the source of it seems to be a Twitter feud between him and another state legislator where the other guy references a tweet that claims an anonymous source for this. Weak.
> It turned out there was an incomprehensible plot to defraud the Gaetz's out of $25 million...If your head is spinning in disbelief, that's the appropriate response. None of that made a lick of sense. 
You'd think an article published 4 days after the extortionist pleaded guilty to extortion would mention this fact rather than write paragraphs about how far-fetched the plot was. Obviously the Biden DOJ, which accepted the plea and wrote a press release about it, finds the story to make sense despite the author's incredulity. The failure to mention this plea removes any shred of credibility this author might have had. 
> He was a congressman in his late 30s who had never been married or even romantically associated with anyone. I think it's fair to say that many assumed he was gay. After all, being a Republican in an ultra-conservative district, that's the kind of thing you might want to keep quiet. I mean his colorful suits and immaculate hair just screamed closeted homosexual.
Is it actually OK to just assume people are probably gay because they are single, dress well, and have good hair? I've seen the left lob these accusations at others (like Lindsay Graham) and I can't help but feel like this would be considered homophobic if the right did it.
I could go on, but it's tiring to try to fact-check this stuff given the author's twisting.

First,  remove all Intel Pentium and Celeron computer processor chips from  personal computers (desktops, laptops and notebooks) as these were  either developed or manufactured in Israel.
Note that the  revolutionary new Ivy Bridge processor will be manufactured in  Israel. Any computers running the Windows XT operating system must be  turned off immediately as this was developed in Israel. All current  Microsoft operating systems are not to be used as Microsoft is heavily  reliant on its Israel R&D centre.
**Step 2**.  Any computers that still work need to have their anti-virus software  and personal firewalls removed as this technology originated in Israel.  The organisation's firewall will also need to be switched off. Staff  should no longer open external emails as most of these will be infected  with viruses. No outgoing emails can be sent. The algorithm (code)  that's used today for sending e-mails, was made by an Israeli who worked  at the Ben-Gurion University in Be'er-Sheva in 1980.
**Step 3**.  Discard all mobile phones, as this technology was developed in Israel,  where the first mobile phones were manufactured. Mobile chip technology  from a single Israeli company has now been installed in over 100 million  devices. Only top-level staff may retain mobile phones for emergency  situations. However the use of SMS (Texting) is expressly forbidden as  this facility was developed in Israel. No 4G devices can be used, as the  chipset is Israeli.
**Step 4**. Turn off  your voice-mail service and delete any recorded messages. Israeli  companies invented the voice-mail system. If someone you do not know  answers your phone-call, then hang up. Israeli call-centres and  call-centre technology is in widespread operation in the UK.
**Step 5**.  Before accepting any printed material, check that the supplier has not  used the Israeli device that might have saved up to 50% of the ink used.
**Step 6**.  At home, do not use Facebook as many in-built and add-on applications  are Israeli-developed. Do not watch videos on the Internet as the  platform used to upload them may be from AOL and hence from an Israeli  company. Do not use the Internet to search for answers to your questions  as this may involve use of an Israeli-developed search engine. Better  to remain unenlightened.
**Step 7**. On your  TV or home entertainment centre, do not use Video On Demand (VOD) to  watch movies as you may inadvertently see an advert displayed  using Israeli software. Do not purchase any games devices as these are  likely to use Israeli technology.
**Step 8**.  Do not read books using an e-book as this may contain Israeli  technology. Do not use data storage as it may have been developed at  Israel's storage technology R&D center.
**Step 9**.  Do not buy an electric car as it is likely to be powered with  an Israeli battery or use Israeli developed charging mats. Continue to  sit in traffic knowing that you are polluting the environment and  financing oil-rich despotic regimes.
Turning to  food and drink, all food outlets on the organisation's premises must  dispose of cherry tomatoes, which were developed in Israel. Staff must  ensure that no cherry tomatoes are included in sandwiches brought into  office premises. The ban also applies to honey and any products derived  from honey. Israel has developed solutions to the worldwide problem of  bee-colony collapse, so that any products derived from bees might only  be available now due to an Israeli invention.
Avoid  drinking any of the world-recognized award-winning Israeli wines. Do not  consume homemade drinks from Israeli-manufactured household drinks  machines.
Avoid any fruit from South Africa or Peru as produce from these countries is being marketed with Israeli brand names.
No  agricultural products from the following areas must be consumed as they  use water irrigation and agricultural technology provided directly from  Israel. This includes most of Africa, China, India, Indonesia (a Muslim  country), Nepal and many others.
Much fruit and  vegetables (including organic) imported into the UK has been enhanced  using Israeli technology. This may save millions of people from starving  around the world, but is not a good reason for you to eat it. To be  safe, only eat fruit and vegetables that you have grown yourself using  seeds that have been in your family for generations.
Destroy  all personal medication. Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals, the largest  generic drugs company in the world, will have manufactured many of your  medicines.  Staff with the following illnesses will need to take  specific precautions.
Cancer – do not take any form of  medication or treatment. Israeli scientists have been working at the  forefront of oncology for decades.
AIDS and HIV – beware;  researchers at Israel's Weizmann Institute or Hebrew University  developed or improved AZT and Hypericin-based drugs; they have also  developed a treatment that destroys HIV-infected cells without damaging  healthy ones.
Diabetes – do not measure or inject Insulin using the devices developed by Israeli scientists.
Multiple  Sclerosis – stop taking Copaxone, one of the most efficient medicines  and the only non-interferon agent, as Teva developed it.  Don't  touch Laquinimod either.
Parkinson's – remove the  Israel-pioneered brain pacemaker to stop tremors. Discontinue Levodopa,  which reduces motor disturbances. Cease sessions that involve magnetic  cortex stimulation.
Staff with a family history of heart  disease and arteriosclerosis must not use the Israeli device for early  detection of these.  Rather, wait until onset of the disease.
Epileptics  – stop treatment that may have benefited from the Israeli discovery of  the underlying mutant gene; also throw away the bracelet that sends out  an alert when a person goes into seizure.
Staff or relatives with Age-related Macular Degeneration – remove Israeli implants that arrest the disease.
Liver disease – abandon Israeli-developed antibody immunotherapy treatments.
Emphysema – steer clear of the Israeli protein replacement therapy.
Myeloma – stop taking the drug Velcade, which was developed over a period of 30 years by scientists at Haifa.
Sleep apnea – no tests using the breakthrough Israeli device for diagnosis.
Dyslexics must not benefit from the Israeli Internet-based reading system.
Skin allergies must be treated with steroid creams only, as the new safer non-steroid alternative is Israeli.
Any  incident of stroke or head trauma or onset of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,  MS, epilepsy, glaucoma or brain tumor must avoid using any of the  Weizmann Institute's patented methods of treatment.
Before  any surgery or medical tests, check that hospital catheters have not  been protected from infection using the new plastic from Israel that  disables microorganisms. Avoid throat surgery as this may utilize  Israeli surgical lasers.
Ensure any colonoscopy or gastro  investigation does not use internal Israeli cameras such as the  Pillcam.  Never undergo surgery to install an artificial heart, as the  first artificial heart transplant took place in Israel.
Kidney  transplant patients must wait for donors of the same blood group as  only Israel's revolutionary new methods allow donors from other blood  groups.  Staff of Arab origin must not make use of the only database for  matching potential Arab donors of bone-marrow – in Israel.
In  the event of a spinal injury or disease, do not accept spinal  implants – likely to be an Israeli product or development. Heart rhythm  problems must not be solved with the Israeli-developed heart pulse  generator. All heart stents are off-limits as most of these originate  from Israeli medical companies.
Check all vaccines as many  of these have been developed in Israel.  Ensure that all X-rays do  carry a radiation risk, as the only radiation-free system is  Israeli.  Treatments derived from Stem Cell research must be avoided  as most of these are Israeli-developed.
If you or your  family are struck with a bacterial infection, do not take alternatives  to older, ineffective bacteria-resistant antibiotics, as an  Israeli discovery will have been responsible for the modern, effective  drugs. Check that any pain relief medication is not based on soya as an  Israeli doctor discovered the beneficial effect of the soya bean.
Do  not use the revolutionary new Israeli bandage that saved the life of  Arizona senator Gabriella Giffords after she was shot in the head.  If  you break a bone badly, reject any treatment that involves introducing  collagen, as this may have been manufactured from Israeli plants.
Do not protect babies and infants from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome with the Babysense system from Israel.
Do not use Epilady (or epilator) – two Israelis invented this hair removal device.
Finally, reject all major dental treatment, as your teeth may need to be scanned with an Israeli-developed dental scanner.
When  interviewing prospective new staff or holding meetings with members of  the public or with individuals from other companies, it is vital that  you check whether they originate from, or are associated with the  following countries and areas. You must ensure that you do not have any  contact with people who have benefited from Israel's aid to those  countries. The organization must avoid any possible acknowledgment of  Israel's contribution to world relief.   In addition, you must obtain a  formal statement from the government of these countries that Israeli aid  was not responsible for the production or development of any goods and  services supplied to the organization.

Pakistan (2005) and Peru (2007) both accepted aid from Israeli NGOs following earthquake disasters.
Peru's hydro-electric power plants are also being built and run by an Israeli company.
Rawanda, Mexico, Chad,  Sudan (Darfur) and Malawi all have received humanitarian aid from  Israel, including medical assistance from Israel's NGO IsraAID.
Always  remember that the boycott extends to any individuals from the above  regions that have been exposed to Israeli assistance during the 63 years  existence of the current Jewish State.
\-Reject  all products from the USA. Analysis conducted in a typical US  stateshows that Israeli innovations were responsible for $2.4 billion in  direct revenue to that state's economy in 2009 and generated nearly  6,000 jobs.
\-Do not tutor your children in advanced  Mathematics techniques, which may have originated in Israel. Also, if  these techniques are used in your children's schools, withdraw your  children immediately.
\-Keen ornithologists should consider  giving up their hobby as many rarespecies stop off or reside in Israel  during their twice-yearly migration.
\-Do not watch the new series of NCIS as one of the actresses is Israeli.
\-Avoid going to any football matches featuring teams with Israeli players.
\-Destroy  all your recordings of Madonna, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Deep  Purple, Bon Jovie, Justin Bieber, George Benson, Moby and many, many  more artists who have ridiculed the illogical boycott and have proudly  performed (or will shortly perform) concerts in Israel.
\-Destroy  any recordings of U2, Lady Gaga, Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, Beck,  Rihanna Coldplay and any artist whose music has been recorded using  the sound technology of the Grammy Award winning Israeli company Wave  Audio. You also must get rid of any personal copies of *Shrek*,*American Beauty* and *Star Wars*. Do not trust anything recorded by Sony, JVC, Toshiba or Dell.
\-Don't go to see *The Black Swan* with Natalie Portman, or watch any old films with Elizabeth Taylor – both lovers of the Jewish State.
\-Do not stay in hotels or visit shopping centers owned by Israeli companies (sorry, you will need to check which ones yourself).
\-Do not have anything to do with the banks who are using Israeli software to prevent fraud.
\-Do  not use any credit or debit card as the Security monitoring system used  by the credit card companies is likely to be Israeli.
\-Do not buy an engagement ring containing a diamond as it is possible that this may have been cut in Israel.
\-Do not travel by air, as your plane might get towed by the Israeli-built "Taxibot."
\-Do not use public transport inside Amsterdam, Moscow or Northern Chinain case you benefit from Israeli transportation devices.
\-If  you suffer a power or network failure, be grateful that at least you  haven't installed the Israeli system that prevents power outages.
\-Finally,  you need to leave all your taps running when you leave home and must  never flush your  toilet, because Israel provides water-saving technology to over half of  the planet. It also is providing sewage treatment technology across the  world, including to the UK. It should be obvious by now that all the  measures specified in Parts 1 – 4 of this series of blogs will  inevitably mean that your organization and your staff will be completely  unable to function.  Let's therefore hope that the decision by your  organization to boycott Israeli products is flushed down the toilet of  history.

From  1966 onward Coca-Cola has been a  staunch supporter of Israel. Recently  the Government of Israel Economic  Mission honored Coca-Cola at the  Israel Trade Award Dinner for its  continued support of Israel for the  last 30 years and for refusing to  abide by the Arab League boycott of  Israel.
NESTLE
Swiss food giant Nestle will set up a   global research and development center for snack foods next year in   Sderot, a town in Israel's Negev desert, the Maariv newspaper reported   on Sunday. Nestle owns 50.1 percent of Israeli food maker Osem   Investments and the two together produce snack foods at a plant in   Sderot.
DISNEY
The Disney Company is owned by Jewish  Mogul  Michael Eisner. He owns a vast media empire that includes the  ABC  television network, numerous news dailies, national magazines,  Hollywood  film companies and a large number of radio stations. One  radio station  in Los Angeles, KABC 790 AM recently broadcast comments  by Jewess Gloria  Alred to the effect that the Islamic prisoners at  Guantanamo should be  tortured by having their "balls" extracted with  pliers in order to make  them talk. The news and commentaries made  through Michael Eisner's media  octopus are extremely Islamophobic and  anti-Palestinian.

There was a time when people didn't consider digital art to be art, either. Today, many artists use Illustrator, PhotoShop, and other tools to make illustrations and no one bats an eye. Does using filters or copy/pasting elements make something not art anymore? Another interesting example is computer animation where you model something and a computer does a lot of the heavy lifting.

Important Characters:
My dad
New officer
For those who aren't aware, when you flush the toilet in submarines, it's flushed into waste storage tanks.  When the tanks get full enough standard procedure when he was an active submariner, was to pressurize the tanks and open them to the ocean, shooting the tank contents out into the ocean.
During this process, you could use the toilets, but it was discouraged and you were definitely not supposed to flush them, as submarine toilets are flushed via rotation of an oversized ball valve that opens into the waste storage tank system. When the tanks were pressurized it was like firing a potato cannon at whatever or whomever was standing in front of it, according to my dad.
During one of his last tours aboard sub, they got a new officer, both to the boat AND relatively new to the service, who was in his first post aboard any ship or boat prior to this.  My dad said New guy was decent most of the time, but had his moments.  The first time they had to pressurize and vent the waste tanks, dad was one of the engineering crew aboard ship, making sure all the toilet, and other related, valves, were in the correct position, putting up chains across the toilet doorways, generally prepping for cleaning, he's put up the toilet chains and they're just about up to pressure on the tanks, and will then start to vent, and up comes New guy to use the toilet.
Dad says he started to warn new guy about the waste tank cleaning, but new guy was having none of it. He told dad to shut mouth and clear out of the way (emergency, apparently?).  In true Malicious Compliance style, my dad stepped aside, said nothing, and allowed new guy to use the toilet.
My dad says that a couple minutes later, he and other nearby crew hear the thumping loud discharge of what sounds like a cannon, everyone charged into the toilet, and find new guy, mud mask style plastered with his own crap.  It's all over his face, visible up in his nostrils,  unconscious on the floor.
The corpsman onboard later reported, at the bar after they got back, that he had to clean pretty intensly... Under the guy's eyelids, in his mouth and up into his gum lines a little bit, etc. New guy earned a nickname, behind his back, and paid a bit more attention to what people had to say to him after that.
Edit: several requests later, If I remember correctly, guy's last name was something along the lines of Schlitzberger/-en.

Some interesting caviats of BMI include that of a muscular athlete in the overweight range. These people do not have negative health effects because their body fat is within acceptable range. Almost always these people have a BMI of 25-30. It has been determined that an athletic person with a BMI over 30 should still attempt to lose weight.
Also it's been proposed that men should get a +2 BMI unit threshold due to naturally increased muscle mass (overweight being 27-32 )  but this hasn't been studied enough. Also some countries in asia shift the range downward (overweight being 23-28) because negative health effects are determined to happen at that range.

$CEO-Owner of the company
So I am a one-man show in a company of about 250 users (cheap company, they don't think that
I need the extra help since things are running so smoothly)
I took a vacation day yesterday, just to be lazy around the house. It's around 1 pm and
I usually don't answer my phone on my days off, but after letting a call go to voicemail my phone started ringing
immediately, so I answer thinking something must have happened.
$CEO Hi $ME, its $CEO. We just hired somebody and the paperwork is being submitted right now
can we get a PC set up for him right now?
Being the only IT staff I put in a policy that I need AT LEAST 3 days to set up a workstation
for new employees. They have to submit a form with their information that I'll need to set them up in AD. I created a super simple form for their information, email groups, etc...
$ME: Hey $CEO, I'm off today but I might have some time tomorrow to be able to get it set up
just fill out the form that is in the Manager's drive and I'll see what I can do.
I went into work this morning and sorted through my emails, nothing about a new employee.
I see $VP in the hallway walking out of the conference room.
$VP: Hey $ME, how was your day off? The new employee is in there have you had a chance to set
up the PC yet?
$ME: No, I just got in and $CEO never sent me any of the information, and I just got in about
30 minutes ago was just sorting out my morning.
$VP: No worries, $CEO or myself will send it to you shortly.
I grab my coffee and go back to working on my list of 20 things.
$CEO: $ME, have you finished the new employees PC, he finished up with all his paperwork and
the tour of the new building he is ready to get to work.
$ME: Noone sent me the filled out form, I said yesterday if you could get it to me I would have it done today even though we have the 3-day policy in place, but without a name, I can't exactly fill out his information.
$ME: I need a full name, not just a generic first name, without that, I can't make his AD account
and he won't have an email address. I am not going to give him just a local account on a PC.
$CEO: Figure it out then, all I know is I need this PC done now for him, otherwise he is
sitting here getting paid for nothing.
So I went ahead and created an account for someone without a name, I created an account for "Mike Doe" and until I get a filled out form or someone tells me his last name, he will now be Mike Doe in my records.
TLDR-CEO hired someone and expected a PC set up right away, without a full name for me to make

I recently had a spirited discussion with a colleague about the best practice for terminating internet connections in a corporate network setup. My colleague argued that internet connections should not be terminated on the core switches or internal access switches but rather directly on the firewall or using dedicated external WAN switches. I, on the other hand, found myself questioning why so many organizations seem hesitant to connect their core switches to the internet, even if all the core switch is doing is forwarding an unrouted VLAN up to a firewall.  
  
One key point in our discussion was that ISPs often hand off their circuits using a single port.

Testicular cancer is extremely time sensitive especially in younger people.  I waited 3 weeks when I had my problem and I guess that was enough time for the tumor to spread into the lymph vessels at the back of my ball.  Upon suspicion I got an ultrasound same day and by the next day I had already had my orchiectomy scheduled.
Again please get it checked out immediately.  I ended up having mine spread to my lungs and abdomen, had to do chemo, then it came back and I had to get a major surgery done and now I can't have kids.</td><td>0.6992284504625129</td><td>-0.1260546150727917</td><td>4</td></tr>

So I was logged out of my account on iPad and iPhone and couldn't log back in. No amount of reset passwords would help because I wasn't getting their emails. (Yes, I even checked my junk folder). 
I wasn't, however, logged out on desktop. From there I was able to see that someone had changed my email to some overseas account (.in India). I wasn't able to change my email back because it said "that email already exists"
Enter dealing with tech support. It took over a week and not so much as a reply. They said they've been dealing with so much Fortnight problem. If dealing with just Fortnight codes shuts your entire tech support down for a week, then you have some serious issues to tackle. I don't own or play Fortnight so the fact that it crashes DCU tech support for a week is annoying.
In fact Fortnight ended up being my problem. When they did eventually fix my account I saw that my previously read had the Zeropoint comics that supposedly gives you a code for the video game had been read. I have no reason to have read those comics, I'm working on a 90's reread. Since my email was changed they got the code for the game. So someone supposedly with an Indian email address went through all the trouble of changing my email to get the silly game code. And there tech help happens to be in India. Coincidence?
They tried to tell me to make sure I don't share my account or log on to other people's computers. I'm only logged on in 3 places and they're all secured in my possession so I'm going to guess my account info got sold from the inside on there end. And I'm hearing a lot of other people are having trouble logging in. If I hadn't been able to see my email changed from my still logged in desktop I would have still been checking my junk folder for a password reset.
Just keep an eye on your accounts and good luck with tech support.  They eventually got back to me after a week because yesterday I was throwing a temper tantrum all over their message board.

The game offers only three races to choose from each day, plus the two different championship races. It also does a good job of gifting you cars that you will be able to use.
As for all the used copies in your local game store... some people were probably gifted this game and didn't know how much of a racing sim it is. Others may have been kind of disappointed with the game soon after its launch date (it didn't even have a single player campaign mode when it first dropped).

I'm an Underwriter and am very concerned about consumer loan defaults when student loans come due in October.
I am an underwriter at a small credit union, would love to hear how other institutions have been handling federal student loan borrowers over the last few years. 
My institution has been counting the payment as $0.00 per month during the pause, but obviously these will come due soon. If you're in banking, has your bank/credit union been calculating their normal payment, or have you also been putting it as $0.00?
I am concerned with liquidity. We have been giving out loans like candy at very high rates. Once borrowers start having to pay $400 (national avg) to their student loans again, I am concerned we will begin to see a large wave of defaults on auto loans and repossessions and foreclosures, as so many people paid exorbitant prices the last 3 years, when they otherwise wouldn't have been approved that much with an active student loan payment. 
My director doesn't seem concerned, but to me, mathematically, it's gotta be a ticking timebomb. Thoughts? I think I want to short the banks, but I don't see anyone talking about it other than saying money will get tight for people. You can't repossess a student loan, and if the wave of defaults starts, and again I believe it... almost *has* to, then.... big crash of the banks and consolidation like post-'08. I'll probably lose my job.

I was inspired a while back by someone who was posting their collection of world coins on reddit. Not being a coin guy I looked into how difficult it was to get a coin from every nation. While I'm sure people who complete one coin from every country feel accomplished it doesn't seem terribly difficult so I wanted to step it up a notch.
I have been collecting silver bullion for decades. Some rounds, mostly bars never cared much for the coins. This little adventure has introduced me to a world where after 8 months of heavy studying I am still firmly an armature. I honestly thought one silver coin from every country this will take one or two months tops. 8 months later and I only have the Caribbean. 
I must say the coin world nearly turned me off in the beginning. Between the absolute dishonesty on eBay, they over the top fake machismo of coin shop dealers, and dealing with people selling their coins out of their basement online it's a different world if you're not prepared for it. 
But after I picked up a couple and did some research and saw some coins I really wanted I decided to stick with it. I can understand how this hobby can get very addictive and while I can stop at any time, I just don't want to yet. 
I set some rules for myself to guide my way. Must be denominational coins, no art rounds. I know most countries don't even make their coins anymore and some of these coins you can't spend in the host country but as a general rule no art bullion. I also wanted only whole denomination pieces. No quarters, nickels, or dimes except where I had to like Puerto Rico and US VI quarters. Ultimately I only averaged about $10 above spot per piece which I thought was pretty good considering how difficult and expensive some of the pieces got to be. I had to combine some Dutch Antilles territories because it was getting deep in the weeds and pricy with Bonair and Saba silver pieces.
Ultimately I had fun, I learned a lot. There's a lot of fun coins that I passed up that I wanted but I also had to stay focused to finish the region. I'm still more of a silver bullion guy though. As I spread this out it doesn't feel as impressive as a couple thick stack of bars. But I think I'll keep going. I'm sure there's some difficult roads ahead like African, Asia and South Pacific coins. But I can't wait to start researching and see what's out there.</td><td>0.6992293260569349</td><td>0.1608552687999773</td><td>4</td></tr>

Another story form my time at Sunup working under a Karen.
To summarise I used to work in a disability shared accommodation agency. It's a job where you support 4-6 people with disabilities who share the accommodation. Its shift work, 2 clients per staff member during the day, 1 staff member on a "sleep over" at night. The rosters are 4 week rotating rosters. I was employed as a 0.75 meaning I work 75% of what is considered full time (equating to 57 hours a fortnight). Additional information that is important, on weekdays between 9am-3pm the residents attend various day centre/employment programs with other agencies so staff are not rostered during the day. House supervisors are rostered during the day for there administration work.
I was working in a house I'll call sunup. Sunup had 4 residents and 7 workers. Each house had a house supervisor, they reported to the cluster manager (who managed 6 houses), cluster managers reports to the CEO. My house supervisor was a Karen and I will call her by her title. 
One day while I was working at sunup, one resident was "Tom". Tom was wheel chair bound, non verbal that had a neurologist appointment in a few months. I received a call from the clinic advising me of a cancellation appointment the following day at 9:30 am that is now available. I accepted the appointment, called the cluster manager (it was a rostered day off for Karen) who asked me to work the following morning from 9am-12:30pm and take tom to this appointment, I accepted and the cluster manager said she will email Karen and let her know.
The following day I got to Sunup at 8:55 am, clocked on and said hello to Tom as the previous workers left. I started to prepare Tom for the outing. I heard Karen enter the house at 9:05am I walked down to meet her and was met with a "What the hell are you doing here, you're not working today. Go home" I tried to explain and she said "Did I stutter? I said GO HOME; I did not ask you to work so I'm not paying you to work". 
Cue the Malicious compliance.
I walked over the docking station, clocked out and said.
 
"Ok Karen, as you requested, I'm off. Oh. Tom has an appointment at 9:30am, he is watching TV and he is ready to go. Taxi will be here soon, Cluster Manager emailed you with the details. I'll see you tomorrow for my next shift". As I left she said "wait what?" I closed the front door and walked to my car and drove off. Karen called my mobile and said "Why didn't you tell me about the appointment, can you come back and take him? Ill authorise the pay." 
Me "No. Cluster manager asked me to come in today at 9am, I started today at 9am. You dismissed me at 9:05, as per our award as I was requested to work, and I showed up at work, I'm getting paid the minimum 3.5 hours"
Karen "well as you're getting paid you need to come back in and work it"
Me "well Karen, you did dismiss me and I clocked out. If I came back I'm no longer covered under the Organizations insurance as I'm not clocked on.  I'm entitled to 3.5 hrs of work and I will be paid the 3.5 hours"
Karen "Just clock back on"
Me "well I can't, the award also states I'm entitled to a 3hr break between shifts. I don't know if you're aware but I did just clock out and after that shift I'm tired. Even if I did that means you need to pay me an additional 3.5 hrs. I don't think payroll would be happy paying me 7hrs for a 1hr medical appointment."
Karen "We will discuss this tomorrow!" Karen hung up on me.
I called the cluster manager and informed her of the situation, even though she is a close friend of Karen she acknowledge I was in the right and ensured I'd be getting paid. Karen did not bring it up again.
TLDR Rude Karen payed me 3.5 hrs of pay for 10 minutes of work.
Edit: Karen did take Tom to his appointment.</td><td>I'm thinking that Cokura was going to operate the chair alone, set it to maximum extraction, and let it burn his brain up.</td><td>0.7300107786577701</td><td>0.1011941131601337</td><td>5</td></tr>

Obviously the FBI investigation has been well documented but lots of this other stuff was new to me. I clicked on a few of the sources for some of the more salacious allegations and they were either not backed up by the source or much weaker than the article alleges. I have no idea whether Gaetz is the person this article alleges but I do know this is a hit piece.
> In an incident from 2012, Gaetz and some of his legislator bros got drunk at a Disney resort and made a loud scene in the lobby. He attempted to bribe the front desk attendant with $20 to get access to another guest's room.
The ultimate source for this is here. It alleges that Gaetz was one of many who were there but the assertion that he is the one who did this seems to be made up by the Medium author.
> However, in this case the arresting officer was forced to resign in lieu of being fired in an "unrelated" matter within a week of Gaetz's arrest. The judge then quietly dismissed all charges. He somehow even avoided the suspended license. It's good to have a dad who's a leading state senator. 
Those scare quotes around "unrelated" and the last sentence certainly read like Gaetz and his Dad got this officer fired to make a problem go away. What does the actual article cited tell us?
> On Nov. 10, Anglin made a DUI arrest in Destin. An internal affairs report said that Anglin grabbed the suspect around the neck after he believed the suspect spit on him. But three other deputies, including a trainee, were there as well, and said the spitting was unintentional and that Anglin used unreasonable force. An internal affairs report agreed.
> According to Anglin's personnel file, this was his fourth infraction, and third in a year.
Now it certainly seems like Gaetz should have been charged and convicted, but it's hard to do that when the arresting officer has been fired for repeated misconduct.
> They recalled one incident of him making jokes about hiring strippers for a Super Bowl party he organized. 
A joke about strippers? Scandalous!
> Two sources, including a Republican state representative who served alongside Gaetz in the Florida House in 2014–15, have accused Matt Gaetz of coming up with a sex game when he served in the state legislature.
I have no idea whether this is true, but the source of it seems to be a Twitter feud between him and another state legislator where the other guy references a tweet that claims an anonymous source for this. Weak.
> It turned out there was an incomprehensible plot to defraud the Gaetz's out of $25 million...If your head is spinning in disbelief, that's the appropriate response. None of that made a lick of sense. 
You'd think an article published 4 days after the extortionist pleaded guilty to extortion would mention this fact rather than write paragraphs about how far-fetched the plot was. Obviously the Biden DOJ, which accepted the plea and wrote a press release about it, finds the story to make sense despite the author's incredulity. The failure to mention this plea removes any shred of credibility this author might have had. 
> He was a congressman in his late 30s who had never been married or even romantically associated with anyone. I think it's fair to say that many assumed he was gay. After all, being a Republican in an ultra-conservative district, that's the kind of thing you might want to keep quiet. I mean his colorful suits and immaculate hair just screamed closeted homosexual.
Is it actually OK to just assume people are probably gay because they are single, dress well, and have good hair? I've seen the left lob these accusations at others (like Lindsay Graham) and I can't help but feel like this would be considered homophobic if the right did it.
I could go on, but it's tiring to try to fact-check this stuff given the author's twisting. This piece seems to be a collection of truths, half-truths, and rumors built around the one thing we know is true (the FBI investigation) to push a narrative.</td><td>0.7300117264925992</td><td>0.3112534094144044</td><td>5</td></tr>

Aight, then. This happened back in the day with a teacher I used to work with who taught a class of adult students who took a very high stakes exam. This high stakes exam (unless you passed this you couldn't qualify for scholarships, some aspects of financial aid, etc.) was multiple choice, and I was part of the campus' proctoring  team. This particular teacher didn't like me very much, and I was fine with that. We had different personalities, and that's okay.
This was in important test.  This exam is an important piece of data that the "Haricoma County Community College System" (fictitious name) uses to compare it's success to sister schools across the county, and even across the state. It's not an ACT or SAT, but it's the Junior College version of a GRE, basically. It just happens to be administered in this particular course, which is required by all who attend that major in pretty much anything. Anyway, sorry that this detail was added late, I'm writing this as I"m remembering the details (I copied and pasted this from the bottom to this paragraph that it's in, so sorry if it seems choppy). 
So anyway, during the actual test it was my job to make sure the classroom was fully functional, math helps were covered up, etc. This included covering up the "four quadrants" that were labeled in the four corners. 
The teacher, we'll call Captain Cheat, was okay with *most* of my suggested (demanded) changes. Before the kids took the test I made sure we covered up the four quadrants, but Captain Cheat was determined to have the four letters in the four corners up still. They were literally framed "posters" with fancy decorated letters A, B, C, and D. I was like... ummmmm I don't see how this could help, but suuure. 
Anyway, the students started walking in, looking and the sparse walls, seemed panicked for a second, then relieved to see that there were still letters up. 
This was my first clue of weirdness, but should have really been my second. During the test, I saw the teacher walking around the room, looking at kids' answers. I noticed a *very* interesting pattern that, if you didn't pay attention, you would miss. No words were spoken. 
He would walk past a student. The student would look up at the teacher. The teacher would look away into the middle distance. The student would look at the same middle distance, then bubble in an answer. It was a little weird, but a very consistent pattern. 
I then payed a little closer attention, and saw that some students were better at hiding what the teacher was doing than others. Some kids didn't look where the teacher looked, they just knew what to bubble somehow. 
Then, it happened... a student took their pencil, pointed at a bubbled in letter, looked at the teacher... the teacher looked at me.... I looked away... and saw the teacher look intently at his picture at the corner of the room that said "D".  The kid then clearly changed their answer to D, even mouthing "D", kind of whispering it to themselves even. WOW. 
When testing was over, and every student handed in their scantron and left, I immediately approached the teacher, saying "I can't believe you. Impressive but disappointing, you're literally cheating these students out of an education. You either have them retake this without your magic signs, or I go to the board". 
He responds  
Yes, this dude cringingly said "hashtag"
The first part of Captain Cheater's comment set me off, and at that point, honestly I wasn't probably going to go ham on this guy. This is 100 percent due to the additional cockified cringe-factor of saying "hashtag".  Maybe I'm just jealous because I"M supposed to be cocky-plus-cringe and he's killing my vibe, but either way... I will... I WILL tell somebody who give's a shot... the provost. The provost, indeed, gave a shit. 
This is a community college, which some people see as "lesser than", but I see community college as truly superior for the first two years of college courses. The requirements to teach are having a masters plus five years experience in the field they are teaching, and at the university you'd be in a class of 500 and never really hear from the actual professor. It's cheaper and higher quality education, pretty much across the board. It's a no-brainer. So those Community College haters out there... whatever. 
So anyway I tell the provost, and Captain Cheat is not just brought before the board, but is put on administrative leave instantly. Like INSTANTLY. He wasn't sent away in handcuffs or anything, the stakes weren't THAT high, but this was an exam that affected a lot of peoples' money, and in turn lives.
This guy looked particularly pissed, more so than usual, and I know for a fact that he hasn't worked at the university level since (based on his LinkedIn that says he's working at a "Jarget Warehouse").

Well, there is a reason for that. A very good reason. 
JYMOM and MS didn't really meet until our wedding and didn't talk much there. Afterwards, they had no real extended interactions until the birth of oldest LO. 
MS has a daughter but always assumed she would be in the room when oldest LO was born. I told her *no*. DH told her *no*. JYSIL told her *no*. But, sure enough, when it was go-time, I found myself in the hospital room with DH hugging my face, my mother stepping out to get the nurse and MS parked on the fucking couch. The baby nurse came in and asked if she was staying and she says *yes* at the exact time DH and I said *no* in unison. The nurse pretended not to hear and went on about her business. 
DH didn't have a spine at this time, so he just held my hand tighter and told me it was going to be ok. I started to cry just as JYMOM walked in the room. 
MS, decked out in her Sunday best, legit crossed her legs and smirked at all of us. Another nurse walked in and reminded our group that only two people were allowed in, but MS didn't move. 
Not until JYMOM spoke up, that is. 
Mom looks at her, lowers her voice and simply says:
I got the shivers. Room got cold as ice. DH retreated even more into rubbing my hand and the nurses, visibly shook worked to keep themselves busy. MS looked like she wanted to say something, but the stare down she was receiving will go down in history. So save face, she kinda just glided up out of the couch and out the door without a peep. 
That was the first time she tried my mom. 
The second time was at oldest LO's first birthday party. I wanted a small get together at my house. She complained about not being able to invite a bunch of her friends that we didn't know. She complained it was too far (at the time, we lived closer to her than her daughter did). She complained about the colors. In other words, I could do nothing right. But, most of all, she complained about how she couldn't believe he was turning 1 and how he had never spent the night at herrrr house!
So anyway, party day. Keep in mind, I didn't know this happened until my mom told me after it was all over. I was playing with LO and talking to everyone most of the day anyway. Afterwards, while mom and I were cleaning, she told me that MS tried to corner her about how much time she got to spend with oldest LO. Apparently, MS assumed that my mom has him
overnight all the time, even though we had told MS nobody kept him overnight. What MS didn't know was that my mom already knew about all of this (because we are close) and that my mom also doesn't like anyone messing with her daughter. Of course, I'm paraphrasing, but it went something like this:
MS: you must be so excited since you get to keep LO all the time!
Mom: I *visit* LO when my daughter wants me to, I don't keep LO. 
MS: oh, I'm suuuure you get to keep him! She's never let me have a sleepover with him. 
Mom: no, I don't. But, you already know that because it's something my daughter has already told you. 
MS: are you calling me a liar right now?
Since then, the air has always been chilly around those two, but MS seems to get the point that my mom is not one to be played with.
Edit: Mom has always been the community momma. I have so many surrogate brothers and sisters that it isn't funny!
Something else awesome about her: she gets along with everyone. She encourages boundaries (even putting herself aside to make sure we have them), is never demanding or overbearing and is always kind. My brother had been married and divorced three times (I know), but all of his ex wives still refer to my mom as "Momma" and frequent her house or frequently call just to check in. She's the type of mother I want to be, the type of MIL I want to be. And, I need some of her audacity!</td><td>That sounds like a variation of Management Stack Theory, courtesy of BOFH.

It could be cleared out, or it could be a complete pig's breakfast of whatever was in the stack at the time of the reset, including the item that caused the reset. Simon Travaglia has a much better description of the phenomenon, plus a great working example.
You have to give those people little bits of the process at a time, because larger, more abstract statements use up much more stack and lead to sooner resets.</td><td>0.7300120025477493</td><td>0.2144956143543968</td><td>5</td></tr>

I'd come up through the ranks, so I was (and am) sensitive to the misery of supporting difficult people.
Even as far back as the time of this story, I hated fax machines. Every single tiny little organization in the company seemed able to demand that my group buy and maintain these stupid, fiddly things. As my hatred of them grew, I'd walk around and see them everywhere. It was a nightmare for me.
So, I worked with my boss and got approval for a skunk-works project to use fax capture cards and turn the incoming faxes into TIFF images and forward them as email attachments to the recipient. The project worked, and we scaled up the hardware until we had a box that had sixteen cards in it. We were able to eliminate all the fax machines in the company with this approach, and best of all each person in the company could have their own personal fax number. We could do this because we had a huge block of unused inbound DID numbers that terminated on our Centrex.
After approximately nine hundred million emails to the entire company and several training sessions (that mostly consisted of 'open your email from INBOUND-FAX-xxxx' and you will see your inbound fax' repeated over and over again), we cut over to the new system. People got new business cards hand delivered to their desks, and all was well.
Except for terribly-minor-executive-X in legal (TMEX). This person was apparently having a really, really difficult issue with the new system. He called into the help desk and informed them that he was unable to receive faxes, and that since he was an incredibly important person, he would simply continue to use the old mechanical machine. This was fine, and this situation lasted about a *year*.
After a year or so, the maintenance contract on the old fax machine expired and my boss told me not to renew it. So, we sent an email to TMEX informing him that the old machine would be retired, and that since **\*hundreds\*** of people had been successfully using the new system, we expected that whatever issue he had would no longer be an issue. And so, we disconnected the machine and rolled it away. Everywhere I looked, no fax machines. It was good!
Immediately on Monday we get a call from TMEX.
TMEX "I have missed hundreds of pages of faxes!"
Help Desk Person "They're on the log. Let me check something. "
HDP: "Yes, they were delivered to your inbox"
So the poor person on help desk escalated the situation to me, and I looked into it. Yes indeed, all the faxes had been delivered to his email and were sitting there unread. So I went over to see this super friendly and kind person.
He immediately begins cursing at me and blaming me for everything.
*HE THEN POINTS TO HIS PHYSICAL MAIL ORGANIZER WITH A SLOT ON IT LABELED* ***"INBOX"*** and he yells at me. "See???? There's nothing in my inbox!!! I've missed hundreds of super, insanely, ridiculously important faxes upon which the entire fate of civilization as we know it depend, you massive idiot!!!" (only a slight exaggeration)
So, I ask him to open his email. This insanely brilliant person has created a spam filter and put our fax system in it.
TMEX: "I was getting too many emails! You cannot possibly expect me to look at so many emails!"
So I make him a fax folder on his email client.
The solution was to have one of the poor, hapless admins get his faxes, print them out, and then physically place them in his 'inbox'.
If only I could have legally resorted to violence....</td><td>Your mom is a JN, big-time. As others in the comments have said, mom isn't a "soft place to land", she's a concrete pit with metal spikes -- *stay away*. Your husband is trying to protect his new family from one who clearly wants to cause damage to it, if not outright destruction (i.e. your mother). You and hubby are a team now -- stick together no matter what she tries to do. Your husband is revealing his shiny spine and is trying to do his job to protect you from JNMom's machinations -- put on your sunglasses and hang on, cuz it's going to be a helluva ride.
> I feel like she's saying "I know you're going to get divorced one day, but don't worry, I'll be here for you when that happens."
That's *exactly* what she's saying, and even hoping for. Worst case, *she'll try to bring that prophecy to fulfillment* through her manipulations, just to maintain her control over you. She will try to pit you against hubby; *do not fall into the trap*. You say you don't want to rock the boat. It's understandable, but you *need* to flip that boat over and *throw her out of it*. Do everything you and hubby can to get out of her house and into your own place as quickly as possible. You're freaking out and mad at hubby, even though you agree in principle with what he said.  That's what *she* wants, though -- you angry at *him* instead of *her* over what *she* did wrong. *That's the trap*. Let your anger at him subside, because he did what was necessary at the moment. Your husband is not the enemy here; he's your greatest ally. I think you know that, but years of indoctrination from the *real* enemy have you reacting knee-jerk. Suppress the brainwashing and look at it rationally.
Set those boundaries, set clear penalties, and *stick to them*. If you have trouble doing it, let your husband run interference -- it seems like he's already getting into the battle here, and I think he's up to the task. Until you're strong enough to get all the way out of the FOG, let him be the bad guy (as far as mom is concerned), but don't let him do it alone; *stick with him* -- he's going to need your support. Don't let your mom tear the two of you apart.
> EDIT: I did confront her after the rent thing to let her know I thought we had agreed on just utilities, and she did back down, but it was in that moment we realized some weird dynamics were at play.
Excellent! You stood to her up in a relatively simple matter, and *you won*. Let that build some confidence in yourself. You also begin to see how things are going to start playing out, so be prepared for bigger and harder battles. Take it one battle at a time, one day at a time, and let hubby help -- that's one of the things we husbands are there for in our marriages. Don't get complacent -- get ready for the next encounter.
I'll echo what others have already said -- get some counseling to help you clear the FOG. And above all else, *talk with your husband*. He is there for you, just as much as you are there for him. He seems to have the strength you need right now to get clear -- use it, and eventually you will have your own strength and the confidence to use it.
I know that science-fiction is not everyone's cup of tea, and especially not Star Trek. But there's an episode of Deep Space Nine that I think is worth a watch (season 6, episode 7, "You Are Cordially Invited") -- Worf and Jadzia's wedding ceremony in the last few minutes of the episode. I think it shows a picture of what you and your new husband need to be in your current situation -- a united force fighting against all who would destroy you (i.e. your mother and any flying monkeys she sends your way), watching each other's backs, and picking each other up when something knocks you or hubby down. This *will* be a battle, and you need to be ready to fight it. You have already noticed the problems, and you agree with what hubby wrote. You just need the confidence in both him and the two of you together, and the strength to break through a lifetime of mom's programming.</td><td>0.730014914349574</td><td>-0.0033946898035248</td><td>5</td></tr>

Today i bring you a short tale of my wonderful end users. 
EU: End User
I log in for my normal day and receive my normal morning tickets. Software installs, breakfix and troubleshooting. You know, typical stuff. 
I see a software request for something pretty basic. Easily deployed through SCCM. I add the user to the group and give it the pre-req 20 minutes and reach out to the user
Me: Hi *user* I got your ticket to get *software* installed. If you have a moment today, open your windows menu and search for "Software Center". In there you should see the icon for *software* click on it and then click on INSTALL and it will install. If you need any help please let me know!
About 30 minutes later I get a response:
EU: Hi Obvious, i have looked up and down in the windows menu and i cannot find anything called the software center, please help. 
Not a problem. User is new-ish to our company and probably hasn't even seen the software center. I ping them on Lync
Me: Hi *EU* if you open your windows menu and just type in "Software" it should show up right away. 
Eu: I don't see a place to type. are you sure?
EU: Obvious, i really don't understand. there isn't a place to type. 
Eh, screw it. I walk up to the user's floor and to their desk. They see me coming and drop their head. 
EU: I swear i'm not *that* bad with computer, but typing in that menu doesn't make sense. there isn't a place to type. 
I laugh it off and take the wheel and open the windows menu and type "Software Center" and it shows up immediately.
I'll spare some of the language, but the user was completely blown away by this newest revelation. They now brag to me how they impress everyone around them with their genius knowledge of Windows. 
I love my End Users.</td><td>I once hooked up an external hard drive to my Linux laptop, with the intent of wiping it for reuse elsewhere in my home network. But out of habit and muscle memory, I ran the "make new partition table" command on /dev/sda instead of /dev/sdb, and nuked the laptop's partition table *while it was running!* As usually happens in these matters, I almost immediately realized what I had done, marveled for an instant that the system remained totally operational, and began to contemplate my next steps.
I was saved by several factors: 1. unix-like operating systems typically cache a copy of the partition table and the directory tables in RAM when a partition is mounted; 2. I remembered a story I had previously read, from the days when VAXen roamed wild within the halls and dungeons of academia, about a user who nuked much of the system drive with an ill-advised "rm -rf /" command (or the VAX equivalent thereof), and the efforts undertaken by the system operators to restore the machine from backup tapes without any sort of shutdown, reboot, or indeed even a usable CPIO command; 3. a set of disk recovery utilities previously installed on the laptop; 4. knowledge of Recovery Rule #1: when you have accidentally deleted data, stop immediately and begin recovery operations; and 5. a curiousity to see whether or not I could actually do what I was about to attempt.
The attentive reader will note the absence of any mention of backups in the previous list of factors. The omission was not accidental.
Within a matter of moments, I began a scan of the drive using Photorec (yes, I am now scanning a nuked drive, by executing a program stored on the nuked drive). It soon found the original partition boundaries on the drive and allowed me to write a reconstructed partition table back onto the disk. Day and data saved, I went on with life, and the laptop functioned as if nothing had happened.</td><td>0.7300149240831065</td><td>0.1834685254132508</td><td>5</td></tr>

One of our Polish customers was having a very serious issue with one of their servers, but the parts and manpower required to fix it simply weren't on hand at that time. My colleague who covered Poland had tried explaining this time and again. We knew it was a big one, but there was little we could do.
Little did we know that the customer's management was actually located in Germany. So, lo and behold, the German line starts ringing.
I pick it up to find a very angry man screaming at me in German. Nothing new, told him it'll be fine, I just needed to check the ticket and see what's going on.
As I do so, I realize it's the Polish case, so I tell him I'd pass him on to my colleague who was handling the region. He says alright, but I do point out, before trying to patch him through, that my colleague doesn't speak German. At this point the man erupts and I get one of the genuinely funniest angry lines I've ever heard.
"NO! THAT'S WHY I CALLED THE GERMAN LINE! I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ARGUE IN ENGLISH!"
At this point I simply burst out laughing, not even putting him on hold. Everybody had heard the screams coming through my telephone and turned to see how this will play out.
After I calm down a bit, I just say "Sir, I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna argue with you in German."
Thankfully, at this point, the customer realized how silly the whole thing sounded and managed to calm down, even laughing a bit about his own outburst. I took the case off my colleague's hands, just to make the customer feel a bit better - and so he could yell at me in German - but after that call, the whole thing wound down.

#Format for Top Level Comments:</td><td>Former *Rolling Stone* reporter Matt Taibbi posted this opinion piece yesterday, skewering what he sees as increasingly absurd positions from the left related to "cancel culture". He compares anti-science conservative groups that he covered during the Bush presidency to those today who wish to cancel everything and everyone seen as racist. Examples include standardized testing and blind music auditions, both of which were originally implemented to increase diversity but which now are under attack because they aren't producing enough gains for blacks. He also criticizes a Princeton University proposal to give "faculty of color" additional pay and benefits and the general idea that the left is intolerant of any form of criticism or dissent.
Since the recent rise of BLM, every organization and company, from Aunt Jemima to the Smithsonian, has gone out of its way to try to satisfy the "woke". Criticism of BLM or even acceptance of the diversity of thought is becoming unacceptable. Penn State University had to delete a tweet and apologize after listing 8 groups of students that were welcomed and valued on campus, because one of them was "conservatives". People are fired for liking tweets criticizing BLM, or stating that art by white men should not be specifically excluded from museums. Taibbi seems to be nearly alone in mainstream journalism in being willing to call out the absurdity of this.</td><td>0.7300192438030583</td><td>-0.0262635302697369</td><td>5</td></tr>

One dude used to be a huge drug runner from what I'd heard and was disrespected by some dude at the one bar they have who pistol whipped him. He knew my friend and while I was visiting stopped by to say goodbye cause he was gonna go to jail after shooting the dude so I offered some acid and talking for a few hours instead lol.
Other dude I came across at the bar another time I visited and was wanting to shoot himself from meth and other things he had been going through so I offered him some acid and talking too.
Both told me I'd make a good therapist but I'm not that much of a people person, but I like to help out where I can. In my experiences with people, acid and talking can be pretty therapeutic and give them some introspection they might not have otherwise. 
Anyway the meth world is a hell of a place, I wouldn't recommend it.</td><td>0.7300201607683041</td><td>0.0850145706868381</td><td>5</td></tr>

Then you better stick to the rules. So, I'm in a college communications class of 50 people, not including our teacher. For our midterm, we were to "become the US senate". The class would vote on several classroom measures, with the goal being to "communicate professionally whilst demonstrating competent debate strategies." My teacher often sticks to his word, and we really did make a cool little senate- complete with dress codes, a candy desk, a gavel, and a flag. This is important to note because the teacher wanted our senate to be *as accurate as possible*. 
We were debating several measures, all created by us, the students:
1. Hats should only be allowed in the classroom if they are cowboy hats (passed, 39-11)
2. We should be able to wear pajamas to class (passed, 48-2)
And finally:
3. Fidget/stim toys should not be allowed in the classroom (you'll find out how that went)
I use fidget toys because I have ADHD, they're all pretty silent and the person who wrote this "bill" has it out for me because I get accommodations like extra time and earphones that no one else does. Since we are allowed to talk as long as we desire about any measure, I get comfortable in my seat (since we are all remote) and begin to talk.
5 minutes pass. Then 10. Then 20, and my professor interrupts. 
"Theverylastbraincell, you've talked too long. Give someone else a turn."
I look him dead in the eye. 
The *look* on his *face*. I politely explained that, since this was a senate, I was allowed to filibuster- as in, delay a vote simply by talking us out of time. The other classmates looked at him. He turned red and spluttered, but allowed me to proceed. Grades are based on individual performance, so I knew I wasn't harming anyone but myself- everyone else had already spoken enough. So, my ADHD ass, the one *always scolded for talking too much* successfully filibustered the remaining hour and 36 minutes of our midterm. As for the fallout, my classmate's bill died on delivery and I got a B+ 
Edit: wow, this blew up. Thank you so much for all the awards!! Here's to answer a few questions:
1. There were only three bills, we had decided on them two weeks ago so we could debate them.
2. The professor blocked out 4 hours of the midterm, which is why I was able to filibuster for the remaining 90+ minutes. Everyone else had already spoken a lot because they cared about the other bills but not many people were gonna contest the one that would affect me. 
3. I will not be contesting the grade as I'm happy with it, and the satisfaction of the look on my teacher's face was worth it to me. 
4. I filibustered on about what my ADHD accommodations are, why I need them, the fidgets I use, my favorite books, and what majors I'm thinking about.
5. I use headphones in a remote setting because my dog barks a lot. When we take tests, our cameras are on, but we're muted, so no one else can hear the dog but me. I got my headphones approved by showing the box they came in and I have to show the teacher I'm not wearing any earbuds when I put them on. They're not headphones in the sense that you can listen to anything with them- they're headphones as in the ear protection like you would use in a construction site.</td><td>My wife's family put a jack-o-lantern on top of a CRT TV once when she was a child.

As the term is used legally, witness testimony is a form of evidence (aside, this is why many news articles that say Trump claims things "without evidence" are incorrect). A he said/she said should not be enough for a criminal conviction, but in civil court all you need is for one side to be a little more credible than the other.
Apparently, the jury found the eyewitness testimony including corroboration from her friends of an outcry at the time more credible than Trump's denials. It probably didn't help that even his supporters would admit the guy is a serial liar. Also, the fact that he didn't testify. Or that his "she's not my type" defense lost a lot of credibility when he mistook her for his wife in an old photo.
None of us have any idea whether this happened, and the fact that she doesn't even know the year it happened should hurt her credibility. But Trump has done plenty of damage to his own credibility over the years.</td><td>0.7300219307741074</td><td>-0.0091697090395435</td><td>5</td></tr>

I passed with flying colors... Not to give too much info away, I was hired at an organization as a job title of basically "helper". Well for someone who is supposed to just be helping, I had a ridiculous amount of work. 
Almost all of my coworkers were huge technologically illiterate boomers. So I actually sort of thrived this as a very useful person. For example, one guy would spend half his day copying items and passing them into another program we use. HE DIDN'T EVEN USE CTRL C CTRL V he would right click then copy then go into the files menu or something and "insert copied item from clipboard". He was so proud of himself when he showed me because "don't worry you won't have to retype everything!"
I wrote a program to do this automatically but did not tell him. So I would just run it occasionally as part of my responsibilities. 
Anyway, I did a lot of stuff like this, I'd estimate i saved about 15 hours of work every day, on top of the 8.5 hours I did too! but then insert sergeant fuck face.  (This wasn't the military but I just like to call him that.)
We are having a team meeting when he shows up. White hair combed okayish, a scrunched face, glasses. He just sort of just showed up one day and took notes during our morning meeting. 
At one point someone brought up a name of one of our customers. I said, oh is that the 300 lb guy with a big beard? Sort of as a joke because I mostly do back end stuff. There was a guy like this I recently did some entrance stuff for. But I was wrong and my boss said no it's blah blah some other person.. okay.  Then we talked about that person a bit. 
Fast forward about a week and this Sgt ff is a complete fucking douchebag to me. I don't know why, he will ignore me during group conversations and literally sometimes scoff at me.  Who actually scoffs at people??
I was having a really rough week looking for some extremely important files.  People were yelling all day.  I was exasperated. Too much to do,  I was having anxiety attacks at home in the middle of the night.  But it was Friday so I was pulling through. 
As i looked for this file I ended up deep on our file structure and the search returned a personal folder structure within one of the drives. I clicked out of curiosity and there it was "Sgt ff's notes".
I opened it and there was a whole section about me. This guy basically goes from location to location getting people fired to save the CEOs money. 
And he was working on me now.  I scrolled through his notes and at the very top I saw
"Frosty thought a 4'10 24 year old female patient was a 300 lb bearded man.  Clearly atrocious attention to detail"
That's just ONE example of how completely fucked up his comments were. 
So, in combination with my job (which I generally liked and enjoyed helping people) knowing I wasn't getting paid enough for my effort. This horrible week I had.  And Sgt fuck faces comments, I said fuck this. 
I set up 3 email configurations. 
1. To my boss letting him know I will be taking 2 weeks of vacation time. To be sent at 10pm tonight. 
2. To the company letting them know I will not be present for 2 weeks so whatever work they currently need me to do they will need to do themselves. To be sent Monday morning at 4 AM.
3. For any emails that came in, I set an auto response that said "I will be out for an unknown amount of time, for any routine, emergency, or even occasional items, it is imperative you reach out to Sgt Fuck Face at xxxxx for assistance"
Then? I turned off every automated task I had ever set up. 
Then I swung by ff's temporary office and said "I think I found a way to make your job easier!" He didn't even really turn his head to look at me but just raised one eyebrow.  Then I left. 
I actually got multiple calls on Monday morning I didn't answer. It didn't last long apparently.  But I stayed strong and didn't respond to anything. 
On Wednesday I had a little anxiety about it but I stayed as strong as i could. I thought about the tasks that needed a 2 day turnaround... there's no way some of the guys were keeping up with their normal duties. Guaranteed at least 2 people were no longer doing their normal jobs just to keep up with my automated tasks. 
I got a long email to my personal account (I guess from my resume or when I interviewed) from my boss on Thursday night of the first week!
It went something like this:
"Frosty, I know you're a smart person and probably figured out what the company had us doing. I would say it's very important you call me but that probably isn't going to work I see. 
I've talked with sgt ff's boss, and he will be leaving our location. I explained our progress meetings seemed to be going in the wrong direction and that you are one of our most valuable employees here. 
I am sure you are probably looking at other jobs at this point, or maybe you have even started one. I hope not.  If you could please reach back to me I would like to offer you a raise. It has become very apparent how useful you are around here. I hear about it every day, believe me."
So I came back on Monday with a 10,000 dollar raise and Sgt fuck face out of my face. My boss apologized again in person and said he didn't get a say in it. I think it's a little weird he could have a say after I left, but not before... but I sort of get it.
Edit: Hopefully this is a better edit than most /r/awardspeechedits but I just want to unrelatedly say that while the world seems to be going to shit, every single one of us can start making a difference in it.

It's easy to blame everyone else or industry and carry on like you can't make a difference. But you really can. All of us can. And if everyone starts to live more sustainably, the markets MUST switch and follow US, the people,  the workers. That's the way it works and that's how we get more bicycle lanes and a more sustainable earth where our friends and family can prosper.</td><td>I bought a house with a Ring. Yesterday, after seeing this story, I attempted to enable end-to-end encryption between the camera and my phone, which would block Ring and law enforcement from seeing the camera live or any recordings.
Ring makes this intentionally hard to find and difficult to do. There are 3 steps buried deep in a menu in the app. Eventually, they generate a 9-word passphrase that's about 50 characters long. They advise storing this in a password manager, but they do not allow copying it to the clipboard (at least from the Android app). Therefore, you have to manually retype 50 characters. I screenshotted it, retyped it elsewhere, and attempted to reproduce it as required, but the app said the phrase was wrong. After checking it about 5 times, I gave up. Hanlon's Razor aside, burying the feature this much and requiring users to manually retype 50 characters instead of allowing the clipboard has to be intentional to discourage the use of this feature.
The steps I tried to follow are here. If others find an easier way to make this work, I'd love to hear it.
Edit: took another crack at this by typing on a PC and was able to get the thing enrolled in E2E encryption. But enabling this turns off basically all of the useful features of being on Ring (motion notifications, video pre-roll, shared links, event timeline, and about a dozen others). Why bother having a Ring at that point?</td><td>0.714769423616681</td><td>0.0431990445526273</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: red"><td>Approximately 2-3 years ago, I was working as an on-site technician for a tech support company when I was assigned a job at a medical clinic.</td><td>The rich (which starts at $250,000, IIRC) pay more than 80% of all tax revenue in the US every year; the top *10%* of earners pay *50%* of taxes.</td><td>Doctors Office Running Windows 98 and XP Computers with NT4 Server connected to 10MB HUB!!! (Part 1) Approximately 2-3 years ago, I was working as an on-site technician for a tech support company when I was assigned a job at a medical clinic. The owner of the business had expressed concern over the slow performance and reliability issues of the clinic's computers, but was hesitant to replace them.
Upon arriving at the clinic, I was greeted by one of the doctors who informed me that the clinic's owner would be returning shortly. The doctor showed me behind the front counter, where I saw about 4 computers, all running Windows XP. But then, my attention was caught by another computer, a yellow (previously beige) one, running Windows 98. I knew then that this job was not going to be an easy one.
I had a conversation with the doctor regarding the clinic's computer system "So, these are the 'new' computers," the doctor said, pointing to the Windows XP machines. "And these over here," he continued, gesturing to the Windows 98 computers, "are the 'old' computers. They're for our medical database software. The 'new' computers are for everything else, like email, internet, word processing, etc."
The doctor then invited me into his office to show me the setup, which was similar to the setup in all of the other doctors' offices. The computers in the office consisted of an old Windows 98 computer and a "new" Windows XP computer. The doctor explained that when the clinic upgraded to the "new" computers - around 2008, the medical software did not work, so they had to keep the old computers as well.
At this point, the clinic's owner returned and introduced himself. He mentioned that all of the staff had been complaining about the computers and that previous technicians had told him they could not fix the system. The owner then showed me the "server" room, which was a small, dusty room filled with a disorganized mess of cables and outdated equipment. One some shelves there was a switch with a mess of cables coming from holes in the walls and ceiling - no patch panel, just terminated and plugged in to the switch, and an ancient D-Link wireless router. And then I saw the 'server' - an old Compaq server from the mid-1990s, connected to a CRT monitor, keyboard, and mouse - all on the floor. The server ran Windows NT 4.0.
I explained to the owner that the ancient system should be removed and replaced with a more modern software solution, but the owner felt that the software was too expensive and that the current system worked fine for them. He just wanted it "fixed".
As a temporary solution, I suggested building two separate networks to separate the "old" computers, and not connecting it to the internet. I got a proper gigabit switch - the old one was actually a hub! for the "new" computers, and kept the "old" 98 systems connected to the hub. The ISP supplied modem was also a router, which then connected to the D-Link router so that was a double NAT. I threw the dlink router in the trash and connected the switch to the ISP modem/router.
The server, which was an old Compaq server from the mid-1990s, needed to be accessed by both the old and new computers, luckily it had a second unused NIC, so I connected one to the legacy computer network and set up the spare one for the new network. When I logged into the server i didn't need to ask the client for the password - it was written on a sticker attached to the side of the server, nothing surprised me at this point. When I logged on I found that there was no backup solution. I asked the client about this and assured me he had a backup. He found a pile of CDs and handed them to me, one of these will be the "backup".
It turns out that the "backups" were just the windows installation images and some Symantec ghost images for the operating systems and software. I found one disc labeled "Database backup - 2015".
This server acted as a domain controller, file server, as well as the database for the medical software. I explained the backup was so outdated it was worthless, he admitted the last person who knew how to do them left years ago, I asked if that was in 2015, and he said that sounded about right. I figured out how to backup the medical database and burned it onto a blank cd I found in the pile in the event the hard drive fails.
I re-imaged all of the virus ridden XP computers with the ghost backups i found - done by whomever set up the system in 2008! All i needed to do was re-join them to the NT domain and they worked.
Although the system was working better than before - mainly due to the hub being replaced with a proper switch as well as the viruses gone,  I explained to the owner that the Windows XP machines needed to be replaced with modern computers - or at least upgraded to windows 10 and a new server was necessary as the old one was incompatible with Windows 10 clients (as far as I can tell there is no way to make windows 10 join a windows nt4 domain). I also told him the network cables needed to be replaced and terminated properly with a patch panel, and wall outlets.
My plan was to get a new server and setup a new domain controller and virtualize the NT server for the database software, I could then upgrade the Core 2 Duo computers to Windows 10 until the client could afford new computers. The owner agreed but said that the funds for these replacements would not be available in his budget until the next year. I reiterated that this was a temporary fix, and the server needed to be replaced now, it was running ancient mechanical hard drives and there was no backups. If it fails then he would loose all of his customers medical records as well as the company's files. I told him he needed to find a way to make it happen as soon as possible. He said he would call next week to sort it out. I also explained that the Windows 98 computers needed to go as well. He said he would think about it, but didn't realistically see that happening anytime soon. He went on about how he had spent tens of thousands on this software, even though that was 25+ years ago.
I got the client quote for a cheap server which would do what he needed it to do and I left the problem in his hands, but he never got back us - at least not for several years.
Late last year we heard from the same medical clinic - It turns out he unsurprisingly didn't take my advice to upgrade the system and I was sent out to this client once again I will tell that story next time!</td><td>Look at the IRS stats.

I drove to the store in my broken car that should not be driven (but uber was $14 each way so I did it anyway). I bought the only sealant thing they had ($8) and spent an hour trying to reseal the outlet myself since the person I hired for the job didn't have sealant.

In order to do that I have to drive across town to get money out (25min) and then drive back to pay him in person. That's another hour of my life plus the cost of gas, and further messing up my broken car by driving with a cylinder misfiring. All because he pressed the reset button.

That is the *exact opposite* of equality. It was always sexist to adjust policy based on sweeping generalizations about sexes or races. For example, just because women *statistically* are smaller and weaker doesn't mean that women should be excluded from jobs requiring size and strength, like firefighters. To make policy based on the *statistical* trait of their sex was sexist. Women fought long and hard for the right to be judged based on *individual merit*, and sure enough many women can, and do, perform work that takes great strength. There are strong women and weak men. Yes, *statistically* men are bigger and stronger, and hence you will *statistically* find more men capable of being firefighters than women, but that is irrelevant to the equality of a test of *individual merit*.
That's the inherent sexism of Ellen Pao's policy, and similar ones. They treat people based on the statistical traits of their sexes, not on their individual merits. It's a reversal of the movement of equality.
With respect to race, Martin Luther King's dream was "I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character." Likewise, gender equality looks to the day when people will not be judged by their biological sex, or their sexual orientation, but by the content of their character and the merit of their skills.
Pao spits on MLK's dream. She changes the rules specifically because of the statistical traits of people's biological sex and not to their individual character or skills.

Obviously the FBI investigation has been well documented but lots of this other stuff was new to me. I clicked on a few of the sources for some of the more salacious allegations and they were either not backed up by the source or much weaker than the article alleges. I have no idea whether Gaetz is the person this article alleges but I do know this is a hit piece.
> In an incident from 2012, Gaetz and some of his legislator bros got drunk at a Disney resort and made a loud scene in the lobby. He attempted to bribe the front desk attendant with $20 to get access to another guest's room.
The ultimate source for this is here. It alleges that Gaetz was one of many who were there but the assertion that he is the one who did this seems to be made up by the Medium author.
> However, in this case the arresting officer was forced to resign in lieu of being fired in an "unrelated" matter within a week of Gaetz's arrest. The judge then quietly dismissed all charges. He somehow even avoided the suspended license. It's good to have a dad who's a leading state senator. 
Those scare quotes around "unrelated" and the last sentence certainly read like Gaetz and his Dad got this officer fired to make a problem go away. What does the actual article cited tell us?
> On Nov. 10, Anglin made a DUI arrest in Destin. An internal affairs report said that Anglin grabbed the suspect around the neck after he believed the suspect spit on him. But three other deputies, including a trainee, were there as well, and said the spitting was unintentional and that Anglin used unreasonable force. An internal affairs report agreed.
> According to Anglin's personnel file, this was his fourth infraction, and third in a year.
Now it certainly seems like Gaetz should have been charged and convicted, but it's hard to do that when the arresting officer has been fired for repeated misconduct.
> They recalled one incident of him making jokes about hiring strippers for a Super Bowl party he organized. 
A joke about strippers? Scandalous!
> Two sources, including a Republican state representative who served alongside Gaetz in the Florida House in 2014–15, have accused Matt Gaetz of coming up with a sex game when he served in the state legislature.
I have no idea whether this is true, but the source of it seems to be a Twitter feud between him and another state legislator where the other guy references a tweet that claims an anonymous source for this. Weak.
> It turned out there was an incomprehensible plot to defraud the Gaetz's out of $25 million...If your head is spinning in disbelief, that's the appropriate response. None of that made a lick of sense. 
You'd think an article published 4 days after the extortionist pleaded guilty to extortion would mention this fact rather than write paragraphs about how far-fetched the plot was. Obviously the Biden DOJ, which accepted the plea and wrote a press release about it, finds the story to make sense despite the author's incredulity. The failure to mention this plea removes any shred of credibility this author might have had. 
> He was a congressman in his late 30s who had never been married or even romantically associated with anyone. I think it's fair to say that many assumed he was gay. After all, being a Republican in an ultra-conservative district, that's the kind of thing you might want to keep quiet. I mean his colorful suits and immaculate hair just screamed closeted homosexual.
Is it actually OK to just assume people are probably gay because they are single, dress well, and have good hair? I've seen the left lob these accusations at others (like Lindsay Graham) and I can't help but feel like this would be considered homophobic if the right did it.
I could go on, but it's tiring to try to fact-check this stuff given the author's twisting. This piece seems to be a collection of truths, half-truths, and rumors built around the one thing we know is true (the FBI investigation) to push a narrative.</td><td>0.7147761217362882</td><td>-0.0332797216052707</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: red"><td>I'll go ahead and copy out the relevant sections here: > Catch, Interception, Recovery >> a.</td><td>It's not clear if everyone that the US and other G-7 countries want out can get out in that time, or what will happen if they don't.</td><td>My thoughts on the Clemson Incompletion: What's a Catch? In the past 12 or so hours since the end of the OSU v. Clemson game I've seen a lot of hot takes, misunderstandings, and straight up misinformation about what is or isn't a catch. I thought I'd try and do a write up of this call in particular, mainly because what I've seen thus far seems inadequate.
If you want the **TLDR: I think they got the call correct by overturning it.**
Without further ado, let's break this down.
The NCAA provides for us the rules free of charge. I'll go ahead and copy out the relevant sections here:
> Catch, Interception, Recovery
>> a. To catch a ball means that a player:
>>> 1. Secures firm control with the hand(s) or arm(s) of a live ball in flight before the ball touches the ground, and
>>> 3. Maintains control of the ball long enough to enable him to perform an act common to the game, i.e., long enough to pitch or hand the ball, advance it, avoid or ward off an opponent, etc., 
>> h. When in question, the catch, recovery or interception is not completed. 
We will circle back to these later
>Procedures
>> c. All reviews shall be based upon video evidence provided by and coming directly from the televised production of the game or from other video means available to the replay official that is also available to the television producer. 
I do not have a copy of the CCA Mechanics Manual, but at this level of football, officials are instructed to beanbag fumbles and review them in the booth. If one of the NCAA officials on here could copy out the phrasing, please do.
So now that we've established these lets jump right in
These are enumerated above, but to expand on them:
* Tucking the ball
* Extending the ball for the goal line
* Moving the ball away from a defender
* Advancing under your own power
* Taking steps BY ITSELF is not an act common to the game. Maintaining feet from the point of contact is not indicative in and of itself a move common to the game. Imagine in this hypothetical scenario that that the Clemson WR had remained with his hands on the ball and went to the ground. He would have been marked down by forward progress where he initially contacted the ball, as he did not actively make these steps. So lets dispense with that one right now.
* Trying to do any of the above and failing in the process is not indicative of a move common to the game.
* The speed of the ball carrying it to your helmet is not a move common to the game. 
**Looking at replays and thinking through the process**
Unfortunately these are the only clips I have from the game, as most of the articles through page 3 of google simply use the sportscenter slowmo. If anyone has other clips please send them too me so I can edit it in.
So full speed, the HLJ is perfectly in position to make this call. He's about 3 yards from the play, judging by where his hat is pointed he's staring right at this catch. As soon as he sees the ball come out, he drops his beanbag and runs to the GL for the reverse mechanic, and the R signals the TD. As a scoring play, it immediately goes to review.
Looking back at the mechanics manual, the HLJ drops the bean bag to cover himself. If he blows the whistle and it was in-fact a fumble for a TD, he's probably never going to work a CFP game again for having an inadvertent whistle on a scoring play.
Now that we are in the review, we need to have firm control, and an act common to the game.
Full Speed Front View - From here we can see that the steps taken are from the force of contact by the DB from the moment of catching, the steps alone do not count as our move common. This leaves an attempt to ward or tuck.
Slow Motion Back Cam - From 0:03 to 0:05 we can see the WR left hand come off of the ball while attempting to tuck it to his waist, at which point the ball is dislodged by the DB.
Given this, I don't think this is a catch, but it's still a very close call.
Circling back to subsection h, *"When in question, the catch, recovery or interception is not completed."* Given that the HLJ let the play go as he wasn't sure it was a catch or not, and that it seems unclear after looking at this all day whether he completes his act common, this is ruled incomplete.
For games such as this, the call is reviewed at the SEC HQ, the replay booth, and on the field. Given that all crews independently came to the same conclusion, I feel quite confident that this was the right call.
*Can the replay booth/HQ overrule the field crew?*
No, the ruling of the white hat on the field is final. That said, he is subject to a post game review process by the conference.
*But what about hypothetical scenario involving goal line/out of bounds?*
You have to maintain control while doing your move. Simply catching the ball is not enough, it has to be maintained through contact \(see this play\)
I'll add more as I see them come in
*Do you have more clips like this?*
Here's a video where Redding breaks down a very similar play in TAMU v. UA. Notice how the WR successfully tucks and turns under his own power before it's immediately stripped.
Here's a video in which it was called an incompletion, TAMU vs. LSU. WR never completes his act common to the game before losing control.
This is an incompletion. Steps do not matter if you don't have control.</td><td>Major G-7 allies including the UK, France, and Germany had a meeting with the Biden administration today to try to convince them to soften the 8/31 deadline for full withdrawal from Afghanistan.
> British Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged defeat on Tuesday after he and other Group of Seven leaders failed to persuade President Joe Biden to delay the U.S. military's withdrawal from Afghanistan...
> Senior British military officers expressed anger over the U.S. pullout, saying it exposes the hollowness of the trans-Atlantic "special relationship" — a phrase used since World War II to stress the bonds of history, friendship and shared diplomatic interests between London and Washington.
> German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the majority of local staff who worked for his country in Afghanistan haven't yet been gotten out and called Tuesday's G-7 meeting "very important" for discussing international access to the Kabul airport beyond August 31.
The administration finds itself in a tough position, as the Taliban has made it clear that it will not accept a troop presence beyond 8/31, but US allies don't want to commit to that date. It's not clear if everyone that the US and other G-7 countries want out can get out in that time, or what will happen if they don't.
I find the foreign policy optics of this interesting, given Biden's campaign promises to restore US relations with our allies and the reputation of the Trump administration as acting alone without consulting them. In this case, Biden seems to be sticking to his plan despite apparently vociferous objections from all relevant major US allies.</td><td>0.7147764182865959</td><td>0.0712615589396289</td><td>5</td></tr>

However, historically, these statues were vividly painted in a practice known as "polychromy" (from Greek, meaning "many colors"). Here's a breakdown of how the Greeks approached the painting of their marble statues:
   - Once a sculpture was carved, the surface would be prepared for painting. This could include smoothing the marble and possibly applying a primer to help the paint adhere better.
   - The Greeks employed a variety of pigments derived from natural materials such as minerals and plants. Common pigments included ochre for red and yellow, malachite for green, azurite for blue, and charcoal or bone black for black. They might have also used expensive imported pigments.
   - The painting would be done meticulously, often with fine brushes to achieve detailed patterns and designs. They used techniques like shading and highlighting to create a more lifelike appearance.
   - In some cases, gilding (the application of gold leaf or gold paint) was used to add further adornment to the statues, indicating jewelry or divine attributes.
   - A varnish or protective coating might be applied to help preserve the paint and provide a sheen to the surface.
   - Over centuries, the paint on the marble sculptures weathered away, often due to exposure to the elements and the passage of time, leaving behind the white marble we see today.
   - Recent technological advancements like UV fluorescence and spectrometry have allowed archaeologists to detect traces of paint on ancient sculptures, providing insight into the polychromatic practices of the Greeks. These discoveries have led to a reevaluation of ancient Greek (and Roman) aesthetics and a better understanding of their artistic practices.
   - Modern recreations of painted ancient sculptures have been created to give a sense of what these artworks would have looked like in their original, polychromatic state. These recreations challenge the long-held perception of white, pristine Greek marble statues and reveal a much more vibrant and colorful aesthetic in ancient Greek art.
The practice of polychromy reflects a rich tradition of artistic expression in ancient Greece, demonstrating a level of sophistication and appreciation for color that is often overlooked when viewing the white marble remains of their iconic sculptures.</td><td>0.7147766897337491</td><td>-0.0466723206179708</td><td>5</td></tr>

So 1 day off every 3 months. None of us in the office get ANY benefits. No PTO, no medical, no holidays, nothing. We were also told that because we (the hygienists) are booked out so far that when we take our day off we will have to come in early or work late to make up for the patients we didn't see that day.

Fortunately hygienists are in crazy high demand in CA right now and all of us already have other job offers.

LEO's will sometimes say this during traffic infractions. However when an LEO mistakenly breaks the law during the performance of their duties, they're typically given qualified immunity. Why are LEO's held to a lesser standard?
America is well known for its vast number of laws, making it nearly impossible for an average citizen to know all of them, requiring hiring professional lawyers to assist them. Given this, wouldn't it be reasonable that ignorance is a valid excuse?
In most careers, professionals are held to a higher standard when an infraction is related to their specialty. For example professional drivers, such as commercial vehicle drivers, receive much higher fines than average personal vehicle drivers. The reasoning is that, as a professional, they should have a greater accountability. Given this, when an LEO has an infraction, shouldn't they too be held to a higher standard? In addition to their profession requiring a greater knowledge of law than the average citizen, they also receive additional driving instruction, putting their knowledge and skills on par with a professional driver.</td><td>0.7147794211100917</td><td>0.0398087763914559</td><td>5</td></tr>

We're talking about average athletes here. College and NFL players are much bigger, much faster, and much stronger. The collisions aren't nearly as powerful in youth football, and the equipment is (for the most part) just as good. When I played in youth leagues ('94 - 98) there were weight classes which helped to prevent mismatches in size. 
You're also taught to "form tackle" in youth football, not to take peoples heads off. Stay low, put a shoulder in their mid-section, wrap the legs, and roll. When you get to higher levels of football you don't practice the fundamentals like you do as a youngster.
As far as anecdotal evidence goes - I started from '94 to '02 in youth leagues and high school, I played all different positions (fullback, linebacker, d-line, o-line, long snapper, kickoffs,  you name it) and never had a serious injury. Nothing broken - maybe the occasional sprained ankle or stinger.

I posted the following, rational response and had it censored. 
"This phraseology "climate change denier", is not only inaccurate, it is insulting. Nobody seriously denies that the climate is warming and nobody calls themselves a "climate change denier". That is a label given to people who are skeptical of the claims of doom and gloom made by the eco-warriors.
What is a matter of debate is whether the change is man-made and whether it is something to be alarmed about. Despite what some would have you believe, science is never settled and there are legitimate scientific reasons to question the consensus that the climate's change is anthropogenic in nature and that a crisis is imminent if not already happening.
There was a time when Eugenics was the consensus best way to improve humanity. Science is not done by consensus and skepticism is a fundamental part of science.
Using the word denier is not only inaccurate for the reason mentioned before, it is insulting because it tries to attribute the same negative feelings associated with holocaust deniers.
"The world is literally a greener place than it was 20 years ago." This according to NASA. Worldwide, poverty is at all time lows.

What's more, the US is polluting the air and water less, emitting fewer greenhouse gases, and replenishing endangered animal populations.
The bottom line is that the climate change hysteria is not a science-based movement. It is a political movement. Scientist don't call skeptics of their science "Heretics". That is more the language of a religion than it is of science."

How much do you want to include in an article? If you list *all* advantages and disadvantages, you are never going to finish. It can just as much be **mis**leading to bring up wait times in this debate. Because private health care is not going to go away in the US. They have private health care in the UK.

But the public option would be delivered according to resources and urgency. And sometimes you would have to wait. Public systems can be tailored to be very efficient on delivery. That's not easy.

They were always off, she tells us, and each time we call we ask for some specifics so we can investigate. She never sends us anything and just waits about a week and calls again. Finally, though, she's ready to speak with someone and I'm bored so I decide to call her back and deal with it.
After a few confusing minutes with her I realize that the numbers in question are the daily and monthly deposit variance numbers. She scans and emails be a few examples that have the "Actual Deposit" number crossed out and then a number hand written. She explains that the "Actual Deposit" numbers are wrong and that the hand written numbers are her corrections. She wants to know why those numbers are never correct and are sometimes off by a huge margin.
Her question is, where to the "Actual Deposit" numbers come from and how can we make them correct. This is where I explain that the person closing out for the day is the one that enters those numbers, right before this report prints. She tells me that she's the one who does that and that my explanation makes no sense because she'd know if she were the one entering those numbers. I have her do a test. If you reprint a report for a previous day you have the option of entering these numbers again and overwriting the originals.
She prints the report and I ask her what she entered when asked for the deposit amounts. She tells me that the numbers are different this time, though. I ask her to do it one more time and to stop at each step, selecting the report, selecting the date, entering deposit amounts, clicking the print button. She pauses for me at the report selection, date selection, and then I hear some keys quickly typed, and then she pauses before clicking the print button. I ask her what that typing was and she tells me she really doesn't know. A window pops up and she has to type a bunch of numbers and hit Enter a few times to make it go away. WTF?
For months now she's been flying by these fields without even reading the prompts. It turns out she was new to this position and nobody trained her, but seriously spending 30 seconds reading the screen would have solved this from day 1. I don't even know what to think of this because she didn't care enough to read a popup form asking for deposit amounts, but she was counting the deposits and handwriting the daily figures. She clearly cared about accuracy but not enough to read?
After I explain all this to her she gets a little upset and asks why our software lets her enter the wrong numbers every day. She tells me a computer should be able to detect that the numbers are wrong and warn her. It just never sinks in to her that the purpose of these fields is to allow her to hand count the deposits and enter them so that over / short can be calculated.

Sure thing, Bob. I confirmed the email size limit with the law firm, then lovingly, painstakingly parsed out the files for individual emails. I waited until Bob was in a meeting and started shotgunning "Privileged/Confidential - Email 1 of 47" messages to the firm and copying Bob. They emailed me in a panic, begging me to stop, and telling me that a flash drive would be great. I told them that, per Bob, the messages "must be emailed."

If you start to suspect someone in a movie, and see them use an iPad, iphone, ect., Spoiler alert...</td><td>The word "racism" has been completely redefined by the left in the last 5 years. Racism used to have a simple definition: the belief that one race is superior to another, leading to discrimination. Now, it also means something else. The dictionaries have literally been changed. By this definition, **any disparity in outcomes is racist**, even if no explicit bias or discrimination is involved. Conversely, any policy or action that makes outcomes more equal is "anti-racist", even if it is explicitly discriminatory against whites. Further, they state that any person or policy that is not explicitly anti-racist is racist. This is how you end up with people stating things like "only white people can be racist because racism requires power".
One of the most visible proponents of this view is a Boston professor and author named Ibram X Kendi. Here are some excerpts from his bestselling book (source 1, source 2). Apologies for the long quotes, but I want to give appropriate context:
> The opposite of "racist" isn't "not-racist." It is "anti-racist." ... There is no in between safe space of "not racist." The claim of "not racist" neutrality is a mask for racism... The common idea of claiming "color blindness" is akin to the notion of being "not racist"—as with the "not racist," the color-blind individual, by ostensibly failing to see race, fails to see racism and falls into racist passivity. **The language of color blindness—like the language of "not racist"—is a mask to hide racism**...
> A racist policy is any measure that produces or sustains racial inequity between racial groups. An antiracist policy is any measure that produces or sustains racial equity between racial groups. By policy, I mean written and unwritten laws, rules, procedures, processes, regulations, and guidelines that govern people. **There is no such thing as a nonracist or race-neutral policy.** Every policy in every institution in every community in every nation is producing or sustaining either racial inequity or equity between racial groups...
> The defining question is whether the discrimination is creating equity or inequity. If discrimination is creating equity, then it is antiracist. If discrimination is creating inequity, then it is racist. ... **The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination**. The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.
This guy is not some loon. He is widely listened to and these definitions are the basis of how race is taught in corporate diversity trainings and college campuses. The common parlance is now that any inequity of outcomes is oppression and systemic racism. A definition that literally wasn't in the dictionary 5 years ago is now the truth, and questioning it or wanting to be "race-neutral" in your approach to the issue is racist. This is how you end up with policies like states giving preferential vaccine access based on race. MLK's values of "judging people by the content of their character, not the color of their skin" might be considered racist by some today.

Skip the first 2 paragraphs if you want the good stuff and don't care about back story.  My line of work is specific enough that I won't go into detail beyond what is necessary.  I am a product support technician which is basically a glorified electrician that spends 80% of his time on the phone assisting the company's dealers with troubleshooting and answering questions.  My department also sets aside part of the year to put on schools all over the US to help train our dealers and their technicians.  That is really nice because it means I have personally met and trained 90% of the people I have to help over the phone.  Phone calls range from 30 second answers to 4 hour technical monstrosities.
My company has recently released our next generation of products.  We are in the stage of dealing with firmware bugs and supplier caused issues.
The story begins at 4:59 on a Friday when the phone rings.  Since nothing bad could ever happen at this time, I pick up the call and greet someone we'll call Joe.  Joe is an excellent technician and only seems to call with what I would think of as legitimate questions.  Today he was working on one of the new products and his pressure sensor was giving screwy readings.  
Everything except the controller was shut down so pressure should read zero, not 14 PSI.  We went through all the usual checks and got nowhere.  In the back of my head I'm thinking  this is a firmware issue because the hardware is doing everything right.  The computer just isn't crunching numbers correctly.  The only reason I didn't follow through on that line of thinking is because I had talked to 10 other techs on the same model and firmware version where this hadn't come up.  
I was out of ideas and decided it was time to let a true master have a crack at the problem.  I added my boss to the call.  My boss is a great guy and has been helping our dealers fix things for over a decade longer than I've been alive.  He is caught up in about 30 seconds and is pretty much stuck like I am so he has Joe start unhooking sensor wires to see if something changes.  Unhooking the sensor did drop the reading to zero but that just confused us more.  
We continue connecting and disconnecting the sensor to take different voltage readings until. . . 
Joe:  I think I just burned this circuit board.
Insert a Metal Gear Solid !  Over all our heads.  
Boss:  what happened to make you say that?
Joe:  I was having trouble handling the tiny wires and you know that black chip about 2 inches to the right of the input?  It's on fire now.  Can you guys get me a new board ASAP?  
Boss:  I think we might be screwed.  Let me check inventory and the regional warehouses.  
Joe had accidentally touched a 12 VDC maximum wire to a 120 VAC terminal while working with us.  
It really looked like we were screwed.  Production had taken ALL of the spare boards to catch up on a massive back log.  We couldn't even rip one out of our demo units because the truck had already left and wouldn't be back until monday.  Luckily Joe ended up taking a whole new controller meant for another job and installed it.  
I was thinking we had dodged a bullet until joe left a message later saying the new controller was giving the exact same screwy reading.
On Monday after some sinister coercion and some innocent threats involving kneecaps, (us talking to the right person after 2 phonecalls, but I can still dream can't I?) we learned that the manufacturer of the circuit board was loading them with config files that used the wrong voltage range for the pressure.  Nobody else had seen it because they didn't notice the numbers were wrong before pushing settings over the online interface which put in the correct config file.

Seems like a reasonable place to start. The Fed probably knows something about how to measure wealth.
> To derive this, I initially take the nominal net worth aggregates for each wealth group that are provided by the Federal Reserve and subtract out consumer durables. Consumer durables are things like cars and fridges that many academics who work on wealth distributions do not consider wealth.
Red flags starting to rise here. Why wouldn't someone's car count as wealth? And why wouldn't you just use the Federal Reserve's analysis, if you're claiming them as a source? Let's go to them directly to try to fact check something simple: has the wealth of the bottom 50% gone down since 1989, and is it now negative as this article claims? Thankfully, we're only a few clicks away from the answer. 
The fed data sourced by the article shows that the wealth of the bottom 50% was indeed $0.7T in 1989. However, while the article says that the value today is -$0.2T (for a loss of $0.9T), the actual fed source shows the current value to be $1.17T instead. In other words, **instead of decreasing 128%, the wealth of this group actually increased 67%**. Here is the graph directly from the Fed site linked in the article. We can see that the growth was negative, but that the poorest have fared much better since 2013.
> The top 1 percent owns around 32x as many consumer durables (in dollar terms) as the bottom 50 percent owns. So the subtraction of them reduces the inequality between the top 1 percent and bottom 50 percent.
The Fed data sourced shows the exact opposite of this. As of Q4 2018, the bottom 50% owned $1.37T in durable goods, compared to just $0.89T for the top 1%. More importantly, durable goods represent 20% of the assets of the bottom 50%, compared to just 3% of the assets of the top 1%. This should not be surprising: if you're lower-middle-class your car is obviously a higher percentage of your assets than if you're rich. I'm not sure if the Fed data is inflation-adjusted, but no amount of inflation adjustment can turn a positive amount of wealth negative.
The article's conclusion is cherry-picked and manipulated with a statistical sleight of hand that 99% of people won't bother to check. It seems clear to me that the author of this study was clearly trying to find a way to manipulate the reader, and therefore I can disregard this article and this site as a source in the future. I haven't even started to touch on the fact that wealth is a terrible way to measure prosperity (you'd rather be a fresh med school graduate with a -$100K net worth than an Ethiopian villager with a $0 net worth), because articles with misleading manipulations don't even deserve rational conversations.</td><td>0.730024053420395</td><td>-0.0933155215812195</td><td>6</td></tr>

Red flag laws ignore the due process of law by their very nature. With nothing more than a phone call from , you are deprived of your property and your 2nd amendment constitutional rights, which could be argued by some to be an aspect of your liberty.
Due process means that you are allowed to face your accuser in court and plead your case to defend yourself. ERPO hearings are usually held without the accused even being notified, much less allowed to present a defense or cross-examine the person accusing you.
Furthermore, it does not need to be proven you have committed a crime to deprive you of your property. The only requirement is that someone else believes you might commit a crime - harming yourself or others. This opens the door to other similar laws, where you could have your computer confiscated if someone believes you might start cyber bullying or spreading false news for example. It's impossible for the punishment to ***NOT*** be cruel and unusual when no crime has been committed in the first place.
Ignoring the gun debate entirely, red flag laws still set a dangerous precedent that people can be "convicted" and punished while never being arrested, never knowing the charges against them until it's already decided, and never setting foot in a court of law to defend themselves.

In particular, the part about how the process the Navy uses to process these religious exemptions was interesting.
> The Navy uses a fifty-step process to adjudicate religious accommodation requests. Under the standard operating procedures for the process, the first fifteen steps require an administrator to update a prepared disapproval template with the requester's name and rank. **In essence, the Plaintiffs' requests are denied the moment they begin.** That prepared letter is then sent to seven offices for review. After those offices review the disapproval letter, the administrator packages the letter with other religious accommodation requests for final signature. The administrator then prepares an internal memo to Vice Admiral John Nowell, asking him to "sign ... letters disapproving immunization waiver requests based on sincerely held religious beliefs." **Then, at step thirty-five of the process, the administrator is told  — for the first time — to read through the religious accommodation request. At that point, the disapproval letter has already been written**, the religious accommodation request and related documents has already been reviewed by several offices, the disapproval has already been packaged with similar requests, and an internal memo has already been drafted requesting that Vice Admiral Nowell disapprove the religious accommodation request. The administrator is then tasked with reading the request and recording any pertinent information in a spreadsheet. **At no point in the process is the administrator given the opportunity to recommend anything other than disapproval.**
The Navy argues that the lawsuit is premature because they might grant the exemptions or an appeal internally. The judge shows that approval is literally impossible given the Navy's own process, and that all requests for religious exemptions to any vaccine in the last 7 years have been denied.</td><td>0.7300297564223533</td><td>0.0881015552986694</td><td>6</td></tr>

Yesterday, after seeing this story, I attempted to enable end-to-end encryption between the camera and my phone, which would block Ring and law enforcement from seeing the camera live or any recordings.
Ring makes this intentionally hard to find and difficult to do. There are 3 steps buried deep in a menu in the app. Eventually, they generate a 9-word passphrase that's about 50 characters long. They advise storing this in a password manager, but they do not allow copying it to the clipboard (at least from the Android app). Therefore, you have to manually retype 50 characters. I screenshotted it, retyped it elsewhere, and attempted to reproduce it as required, but the app said the phrase was wrong. After checking it about 5 times, I gave up. Hanlon's Razor aside, burying the feature this much and requiring users to manually retype 50 characters instead of allowing the clipboard has to be intentional to discourage the use of this feature.
The steps I tried to follow are here. If others find an easier way to make this work, I'd love to hear it.
Edit: took another crack at this by typing on a PC and was able to get the thing enrolled in E2E encryption. But enabling this turns off basically all of the useful features of being on Ring (motion notifications, video pre-roll, shared links, event timeline, and about a dozen others).

EU: End User
I log in for my normal day and receive my normal morning tickets. Software installs, breakfix and troubleshooting. You know, typical stuff. 
I see a software request for something pretty basic. Easily deployed through SCCM. I add the user to the group and give it the pre-req 20 minutes and reach out to the user
Me: Hi *user* I got your ticket to get *software* installed. If you have a moment today, open your windows menu and search for "Software Center". In there you should see the icon for *software* click on it and then click on INSTALL and it will install. If you need any help please let me know!
About 30 minutes later I get a response:
EU: Hi Obvious, i have looked up and down in the windows menu and i cannot find anything called the software center, please help. 
Not a problem. User is new-ish to our company and probably hasn't even seen the software center. I ping them on Lync
Me: Hi *EU* if you open your windows menu and just type in "Software" it should show up right away. 
Eu: I don't see a place to type. are you sure?
EU: Obvious, i really don't understand. there isn't a place to type. 
Eh, screw it. I walk up to the user's floor and to their desk. They see me coming and drop their head. 
EU: I swear i'm not *that* bad with computer, but typing in that menu doesn't make sense. there isn't a place to type. 
I laugh it off and take the wheel and open the windows menu and type "Software Center" and it shows up immediately.
I'll spare some of the language, but the user was completely blown away by this newest revelation. They now brag to me how they impress everyone around them with their genius knowledge of Windows.

Hey everyone, I've got a bit of a weird question... so if this isn't allowed on the sub, sorry in advance.
I work for a huge company (25K+ employees), and we're nearing completion on our new headquarters. That's all the hints you get, so if you can figure out from there, good job Sherlock. It's honestly an incredible building, with about $6M in new Cisco 9000-series switching and wireless controlled by DNAC, Panduit cable management systems, racks, and cabinets, etc.
I've only got one real problem so far: this shit is dirty... and I mean utter grime. To support construction operations, installation of smart building controls, AV, etc... the core project team wanted us to have the network fully online very early in the construction phase. That meant that construction phases such as drywall, flooring, etc were still very much in progress while the IDFs/MDFs/MMRs were all online. As such, most of our network locations, especially those on the lower levels or attached to the garages, are absolutely covered in dust, debris, etc. You can wipe your finger across a switch and discover the chassis is silver, not black. Literally, in one of our MMR's, one of the vendors wrote the classic "I need a bath" in the dust of the cabinet.
I have no problem admitting, I'm not sure the proper way to clean all of this equipment. Sure, I know the usual compressed air route, but this equipment is in genuine need of a deep clean; and the network has to remain up while doing this, so hence I'm turning to you all. I don't want to wreak havoc with some statically charged or electrically conductive cleaning method, so I need some suggestions. Have any of you faced situations like this before? If so, how did you deal with it?

Had some success with this using CSR1000v to do DMVPN with onprem ISR's, but getting just spoke to spoke working reliably has been difficult and I've all but given up on using the cloud as a DMVPN Hub. I need to review [user] 's links, hopefully I'll pick something up because otherwise hybrid cloud has been a pain and it feels ham-fisted trying to use things like virtual routers in cloud. Lots of dirty NAT's to force it into working the way you would onprem. Vnet to Vnet DMVPN is one of those hackey ways to force cloud to behave like onprem while lining Cisco's wallet. There are other "multicloud" options that work similarly under the hood because it's almost the only way to do it. Native tooling works better / is better integrated to cloud but is lacking when it comes to talking to onprem and other clouds, particularly when you'd like to interconnect using private WAN to give yourself options because anyone who's worth their salt has trust issues with the internet. The rock & hard place I keep running into is cloud to cloud over middlemile(L3VPN or VPLS with managed expressroute/directconnect landings in the underlay, etc) while encrypting everything between cloud to cloud and cloud to onprem to satisfy InfoSec/TheAuditors. The solution seems to be a DMVPN over the top but then I still have problems with device level fault detection / route propagation between my WAN and the L3 "switch" in each cloud. AzureRouteServer ought to help here, but last I knew it was still in beta. I think TransitGateway in AWS can do similar but havn't finished confirming my understanding of it. At the end of the day all this gets you is a traditional DMVPN with circa \~2010 management and relies on your routing protocol to detect and handle brownouts. SDWAN / multicloud options that integrate with things like AzureRouteServer have some promise, but I haven't confirmed they'd support using expressroute/directconnect as an underlay and their documentation diagrams don't indicate it as an option..
This link helped me get a CSR working over internet & private WAN;
The smart network dumb app approach that's traditionally been onprem doesn't work well in cloud but we're frequently told to move dumb apps up to the cloud regardless. When DR is restore this replica in another region but the app can't handle being re-IP'd without also being reinstalled the DR plan turns into "rebuild x app" and management doesn't like that answer.
At the end of the day it strikes me as a mismatch of requirements and capabilities, but ultimately mangelment says "go to the cloud!" because ExecWeekly said so and feels good about themselves moving the compute expense from the capital to the operational column of the budget sheet (even though it costs more since it's on 24/7 and doesn't scale) and we're left to deal with the fallout with our arms tied behind our backs.</td><td>Looks like RPVST is seeing MST as root with the configured prio in the lab.

They come with a battery powered stylus that is recharged when you re-insert it into the laptop.
Being a stylus with metal pins, it needs to, and can only be, inserted one way into the laptop. If you try and insert it any other way, it physically will not fit and you're met with an awful lot of resistance. 
You can see where this story is going.
So yesterday someone walked through the door. We'll call her Beryl. She dropped her laptop off because of some issues she was having with displaying an image on a secondary screen. When I looked at it, I saw that the stylus wasn't inserted correctly, so I went to grab it to re-insert it properly, however it wouldn't budge.
There's a small lip on the end of the stylus (so you can pull it out with your fingernail), so I grabbed a flat head screwdriver and tried to pull it out that way but it still wouldn't budge. In the end I had to grab a pair of pliers and apply a bunch of force to remove it.
Beryl had attempted to reinsert the stylus, found it wouldn't fit, and so instead of rotating it to see if it'd fit, she pushed so goddamn hard that it put a hairline crack in the base AND got the stylus wedged in hard enough that pliers were needed.
And when she was quizzed on how it got stuck, she claimed to not know that the stylus even existed, which my boss called bullshit on immediately.
I'm at a total loss to explain her thought process behind that. It's a fundamental square peg / round hole thing.

The story is about a man who wants to cook some food on his stove, when he comes home in the evening after a full day of work.  In his dark hut, he uses his only source of light, a paraffin lantern, to try to locate his matches to start the fire.  He looks in his closest, opening the doors and peering inside, the lantern lighting the way.  But they are not there.
He goes to the firewood box, and opens it, using the lantern to light the innards - but the matches are not inside.
The shadows of the logs flicker on the wall as he does so.
He goes outside to the latrine - perhaps he left the matches there when he smoked his pipe yesterday?  But alas, they are not there either.
Ripples and small waves shimmer in the light of the lantern, as the pale of water is moved about to search for the small sticks.

It's a semi-Buddhist tale, equivalent to "can't see the forest for the trees".
If he stopped and thought about it, his candlelight - the lantern - could have been used to start the stove.  If he knew the candlelight was fire, the meal would have been cooked much earlier in the day, and he would have been satisfied when he slept, and been fresh for work tomorrow.

Couple of years ago I was still working at an MSP supporting multiple different companies. Our biggest client at the time was a pharmaceutical analysis company. Part of some users hobs was to go to various hospitals or pharmaceutical sites and monitor trials and tests.
U = user (PhD, massive chip on his shoulder)
ITM = Client IT manager (sweet old lady, lovely to deal with, can get very cross)
Ticket: HI team, I would like to replace my machine (Laptop) as it is not working on all sites, please see the link below for the machine we know works on all sites.
IT: WTH, 16 Gb octo core Lenovo machine?! This guy wants this for private use to load games or something. And why is there no tickets for machine failure for us to trouble shoot.
IT : HI (blank), I see you are having some trouble with your machine? What seems to be the problem?
U: it doesn't work on some sites, but on those sites they all use Lenovo machines and they have no problems. I want a new machine and I have approval from my region manager to request the same machines for every one in the field.
(2 - 10 field agents for every country in the eu. This also doesn't include africa or the us)
IT: ok well first, that will need to go the head office for approval, secondly we need to look at the trouble machine to see what's wrong as we might be able to fix it.
U: No, I don't want to waste time on that, I will contact HQ and get the approval... click
IT:Crap, ITM is gonna have a field day with this rubbish.
Spoke to ITM and they agreed that the request is ridiculous, trouble shoot the issue and they can get a standard replacement if needed.
U: I've been told that you must look at my machine. I'm on site and it's not working.
IT: so what is it doing? Not connecting, application freeze, BSOD?
IT: And this only happens on certain sites.
U: yes, but not always the same site. It works from home and it works on-site if I use my mobile Hotspot.
IT: ok, sounds like a network issue, (never seen its like,  ask senior techs and they also never heard of this intermittent issue before). Can you restart the machine and I will connect before you login. 
Restarts machine, I load up the remote software and connect.
Immediate loss of connection when he hits enter.
IT: ok I assume it crashed. Can you connect via your phone so I can have a look.
U: that's going to cost me alot for data.
IT: its a company issued phone, I will notify accounts and the company will cover it.
Connect to the machine and find the error, do some googling and it turns out it's a driver failure. Reload new drivers and test again.
U: its logging in now.
5 minutes it runs fine. Connects to the FTP drive, crashes. Check logs again, same error. No new drivers
User goes on leave for a couple of days so I spent some time doing research on this issue but find squat. User comes back from holiday.
IT: ok, so we need this machine to come in so we can do more testing on it. We going to issue you with a new machine for now.
IT: no you are just getting a newer model of the same machine
U: un acceptable, I will call head office.
ITM, shot down his request before it even landed as I was on the phone with her for something else.
So now I'm completely confused, how can one make of machine work everywhere but in one location. Google all the error messages, driver issues and wierd bsod messages and find nothing again.
I go to the HP website to read all the documentation on thier network cards when a message pops up. HP velocity app is being pulled indefinitely as it causes conflicts with certain network equipment. No mention of this was found on any forums or help articles before.
IT: ok let's see what happens if we remove velocity from the machines.
User still tried to angle for a new machine cause "HP machines are obviously faulty if thier own apps cause problems" but ITM shut that down even harder once we rolled out a script to remove velocity for all machines.
TLDR: HP networking bloatware caused machine to bsod and user tried to leverage a beast of a machine from us.</td><td>Trust me: the internet knows your IP address. The internet *must* know your IP address, in order for it to be able to send you the data that you request when you pull up a web page or fetch your email. If the internet *didn't* know your IP address, you won't get any cat videos.
Furthermore, "your" IP address *doesn't belong to you*, plus it changes periodically. It belongs to the ISP that you get your internet service from; they just lease it out to you.
So, what you want to do is use a dynamic DNS service, or DDNS, something like No-IP or Dyn. You'll set up an account with one of those services, pick a domain name, then run a small program on your server which will update that domain name with the IP address currently assigned to your router (it's likely that your router has the capability built into it, so you wouldn't need to install anything anywhere else). Also, forward the ports in your router necessary for them to connect to your Minecraft server.
Now, you just tell your Minecraft friends to connect to your server at myminecraftserver.dynamicdnsservice.tld (don't use that, because it's fake; replace it with your actual dynamic domain name). They can technically still get your IP address, but *that doesn't matter*. And at this point, all they could do with the IP address is exactly what they can do with your DDNS domain name: connect to your Minecraft server, and maybe run a port scan, which at this point would only show the Minecraft server.
BTW, having an IP address *does not* give anyone your exact location. The *best* it can do is show that you use a specific ISP and are located somewhere within a couple hundred square miles of the address on record for that ISP's local office. And for some ISPs, they don't associate IP addresses with specific office locations, so your IP address might locate you to a spot thousands of miles away from your actual geographical location, i.e. the headquarters office of the ISP.</td><td>0.7640060864081057</td><td>0.0403750919616179</td><td>7</td></tr>

Well, there is a reason for that. A very good reason. 
JYMOM and MS didn't really meet until our wedding and didn't talk much there. Afterwards, they had no real extended interactions until the birth of oldest LO. 
MS has a daughter but always assumed she would be in the room when oldest LO was born. I told her *no*. DH told her *no*. JYSIL told her *no*. But, sure enough, when it was go-time, I found myself in the hospital room with DH hugging my face, my mother stepping out to get the nurse and MS parked on the fucking couch. The baby nurse came in and asked if she was staying and she says *yes* at the exact time DH and I said *no* in unison. The nurse pretended not to hear and went on about her business. 
DH didn't have a spine at this time, so he just held my hand tighter and told me it was going to be ok. I started to cry just as JYMOM walked in the room. 
MS, decked out in her Sunday best, legit crossed her legs and smirked at all of us. Another nurse walked in and reminded our group that only two people were allowed in, but MS didn't move. 
Not until JYMOM spoke up, that is. 
Mom looks at her, lowers her voice and simply says:
I got the shivers. Room got cold as ice. DH retreated even more into rubbing my hand and the nurses, visibly shook worked to keep themselves busy. MS looked like she wanted to say something, but the stare down she was receiving will go down in history. So save face, she kinda just glided up out of the couch and out the door without a peep. 
That was the first time she tried my mom. 
The second time was at oldest LO's first birthday party. I wanted a small get together at my house. She complained about not being able to invite a bunch of her friends that we didn't know. She complained it was too far (at the time, we lived closer to her than her daughter did). She complained about the colors. In other words, I could do nothing right. But, most of all, she complained about how she couldn't believe he was turning 1 and how he had never spent the night at herrrr house!
So anyway, party day. Keep in mind, I didn't know this happened until my mom told me after it was all over. I was playing with LO and talking to everyone most of the day anyway. Afterwards, while mom and I were cleaning, she told me that MS tried to corner her about how much time she got to spend with oldest LO. Apparently, MS assumed that my mom has him
overnight all the time, even though we had told MS nobody kept him overnight. What MS didn't know was that my mom already knew about all of this (because we are close) and that my mom also doesn't like anyone messing with her daughter. Of course, I'm paraphrasing, but it went something like this:
MS: you must be so excited since you get to keep LO all the time!
Mom: I *visit* LO when my daughter wants me to, I don't keep LO. 
MS: oh, I'm suuuure you get to keep him! She's never let me have a sleepover with him. 
Mom: no, I don't. But, you already know that because it's something my daughter has already told you. 
MS: are you calling me a liar right now?
Since then, the air has always been chilly around those two, but MS seems to get the point that my mom is not one to be played with.
Edit: Mom has always been the community momma. I have so many surrogate brothers and sisters that it isn't funny!
Something else awesome about her: she gets along with everyone. She encourages boundaries (even putting herself aside to make sure we have them), is never demanding or overbearing and is always kind. My brother had been married and divorced three times (I know), but all of his ex wives still refer to my mom as "Momma" and frequent her house or frequently call just to check in. She's the type of mother I want to be, the type of MIL I want to be. And, I need some of her audacity!</td><td>And also, you have to be at least 25 most of the time to be allowed to be added.
I worked for an orange stripey rental car company in the mid-90s. I wasn't yet 20, so even as an employee I could not rent, but I could drive the cars when we had meetings at HQ 2 hours away (and around town to fuel up or wash). Anyway, we had a special deal with the national lab in our little town, a special rate, and also if you were on lab business you could be 21 to rent. But if it was personal, even as a lab employee, you had to be 25, but you still got a discounted rate.
Lady rents a Toy Turd, er, Toyota Tercel from us for the weekend. She added no additional drivers to the contract, got the lab employee personal rate, don't remember what if any coverage from us. She had her teenage daughter with her, and we made it clear she couldn't drive it.
A couple days later, we had to bring up a couple of drivers from our location about an hour away, to help deal with an accident with one of our cars. Turns out it was this lady's car. She decided to let her daughter's boyfriend drive the thing, probably with the daughter along for the ride. He drove along a mountainous back road (well-maintained state highway, but through some back-roads type areas just outside of town), came upon an elk in the road, swerved to avoid it, caught the tire in the little gutter at the edge of the road, and flipped the car.
I had to go take a look at it at the tow yard, to help prepare it for moving to our main service center at HQ, and it was just rekt. Glass everywhere, battery burst, roof all rolled up, the whole bit. Car was worth about $10k new, the boyfriend did roughly $13k damage to it.

In addition, it's worth noting that the Biden DOJ and Bragg's predecessor both investigated and declined to prosecute this same set of facts. Finally, tackling the statute of limitations question requires the state to argue that Trump has been out of their prosecutorial jurisdiction due to having been president. 
Every legal analysis I've read suggests that the legal theories behind this prosecution are dicey and novel. This one from Reason summarizes it well. Even the NYT says it "hinge[s] on a largely untested and therefore risky legal theory". I'd be interested if anyone can share an unbiased analysis looking at the legal issues here that concludes this is a solid case. 
As others have said, this feels like the kind of thing you only get one shot at. If Trump wins the case, especially if a judge throws it out, it will greatly amplify his supporters' persecution complex going into 2024.
Last thing I'll say, don't underestimate Trump's ability to drive the media narrative and get the outcome he wants. It's how he got elected, and this statement seems to put pressure on the NY DA to act quickly one way or the other.</td><td>0.7640187045132055</td><td>0.142219308894917</td><td>7</td></tr>

Today i bring you a short tale of my wonderful end users. 
EU: End User
I log in for my normal day and receive my normal morning tickets. Software installs, breakfix and troubleshooting. You know, typical stuff. 
I see a software request for something pretty basic. Easily deployed through SCCM. I add the user to the group and give it the pre-req 20 minutes and reach out to the user
Me: Hi *user* I got your ticket to get *software* installed. If you have a moment today, open your windows menu and search for "Software Center". In there you should see the icon for *software* click on it and then click on INSTALL and it will install. If you need any help please let me know!
About 30 minutes later I get a response:
EU: Hi Obvious, i have looked up and down in the windows menu and i cannot find anything called the software center, please help. 
Not a problem. User is new-ish to our company and probably hasn't even seen the software center. I ping them on Lync
Me: Hi *EU* if you open your windows menu and just type in "Software" it should show up right away. 
Eu: I don't see a place to type. are you sure?
EU: Obvious, i really don't understand. there isn't a place to type. 
Eh, screw it. I walk up to the user's floor and to their desk. They see me coming and drop their head. 
EU: I swear i'm not *that* bad with computer, but typing in that menu doesn't make sense. there isn't a place to type. 
I laugh it off and take the wheel and open the windows menu and type "Software Center" and it shows up immediately.
I'll spare some of the language, but the user was completely blown away by this newest revelation. They now brag to me how they impress everyone around them with their genius knowledge of Windows. 
I love my End Users.</td><td>Your mom is a JN, big-time. As others in the comments have said, mom isn't a "soft place to land", she's a concrete pit with metal spikes -- *stay away*. Your husband is trying to protect his new family from one who clearly wants to cause damage to it, if not outright destruction (i.e. your mother). You and hubby are a team now -- stick together no matter what she tries to do. Your husband is revealing his shiny spine and is trying to do his job to protect you from JNMom's machinations -- put on your sunglasses and hang on, cuz it's going to be a helluva ride.
> I feel like she's saying "I know you're going to get divorced one day, but don't worry, I'll be here for you when that happens."
That's *exactly* what she's saying, and even hoping for. Worst case, *she'll try to bring that prophecy to fulfillment* through her manipulations, just to maintain her control over you. She will try to pit you against hubby; *do not fall into the trap*. You say you don't want to rock the boat. It's understandable, but you *need* to flip that boat over and *throw her out of it*. Do everything you and hubby can to get out of her house and into your own place as quickly as possible. You're freaking out and mad at hubby, even though you agree in principle with what he said.  That's what *she* wants, though -- you angry at *him* instead of *her* over what *she* did wrong. *That's the trap*. Let your anger at him subside, because he did what was necessary at the moment. Your husband is not the enemy here; he's your greatest ally. I think you know that, but years of indoctrination from the *real* enemy have you reacting knee-jerk. Suppress the brainwashing and look at it rationally.
Set those boundaries, set clear penalties, and *stick to them*. If you have trouble doing it, let your husband run interference -- it seems like he's already getting into the battle here, and I think he's up to the task. Until you're strong enough to get all the way out of the FOG, let him be the bad guy (as far as mom is concerned), but don't let him do it alone; *stick with him* -- he's going to need your support. Don't let your mom tear the two of you apart.
> EDIT: I did confront her after the rent thing to let her know I thought we had agreed on just utilities, and she did back down, but it was in that moment we realized some weird dynamics were at play.
Excellent! You stood to her up in a relatively simple matter, and *you won*. Let that build some confidence in yourself. You also begin to see how things are going to start playing out, so be prepared for bigger and harder battles. Take it one battle at a time, one day at a time, and let hubby help -- that's one of the things we husbands are there for in our marriages. Don't get complacent -- get ready for the next encounter.
I'll echo what others have already said -- get some counseling to help you clear the FOG. And above all else, *talk with your husband*. He is there for you, just as much as you are there for him. He seems to have the strength you need right now to get clear -- use it, and eventually you will have your own strength and the confidence to use it.
I know that science-fiction is not everyone's cup of tea, and especially not Star Trek. But there's an episode of Deep Space Nine that I think is worth a watch (season 6, episode 7, "You Are Cordially Invited") -- Worf and Jadzia's wedding ceremony in the last few minutes of the episode. I think it shows a picture of what you and your new husband need to be in your current situation -- a united force fighting against all who would destroy you (i.e. your mother and any flying monkeys she sends your way), watching each other's backs, and picking each other up when something knocks you or hubby down. This *will* be a battle, and you need to be ready to fight it. You have already noticed the problems, and you agree with what hubby wrote. You just need the confidence in both him and the two of you together, and the strength to break through a lifetime of mom's programming.</td><td>0.7459649902550984</td><td>0.0127640194755613</td><td>7</td></tr>

I have questions... I'm a not terribly unhealthy man in his early thirties. One month ago, I was diagnosed, and subsequently underwent surgery. My right testicle has been removed. One week later I was told that the tumor was a non-seminoma, and that it was an embryonal carcinoma. The pathologist determined lymphovascular invasion. I think that is the right term for it. I was told the tumor had compromised the blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, giving it the opportunity to metastasize.
  
Tumor markers AFP and HCG were both elevated before the orchiectomy. They did not test for LDH. HCG dropped to negligible levels after the surgery. AFP dropped a little, but remained elevated at a constant level (14?) a week or so later.  
  
A CT scan covering the area from my hips to my shoulders showed no signs of metastasis. My lymph nodes weren't swollen.  
  
The multi-disciplinary team consisting of urologists, oncologists, and radiologists decided to observe 'watchful waiting', rather than starting me on chemo. This decision was confirmed by specialists from another hospital after being consulted by oncologist. From what I understand this is all in line with the national guidelines in my country.  
  
Short timeline:  
  
Day 1: Initial diagnosis by general practitioner  
Day 2: Blood work, ultrasound of testicles and lower abdomen, physical examination, orchiectomy.  
Day 3: CT  
Day 7: New bloodwork. HCG now unmeasurable. AFP lower, but elevated.  
Day 10: New bloodwork. AFP elevated at same level (14?). Physical examination. Told there is no visible metastasis. I'm told I'm Stage I, and that I should consider myself cancer-free for now. No chemo.  
Day 14: Oncologist has discussed my case with team of specialists of other hospital. They agree to not start chemo, and to put me under surveillance, or watchful waiting: I am told I will need to have monthly blood tests, and quarterly CT-scans for the next year. And the same but less frequently in the four years after that.  
  
My next blood test will be on Day 35, which will be 25 days after my last blood test. I will get the results and a new physical examination on Day 40.
Based on what I've read in medical articles and on sites like <URL>, the blood tests in the weeks after diagnosis and orchiectomy should be far more frequent. I also read that my particular brand of tumor along with lymphovascular invasion give me a very high chance of it rearing its head again in the first year.
Please share your experience if you've had a non-seminoma, and embryonal carcinoma in particular. What has your experience been? Is my oncologist doing the right things? Is there anything in my story that jumps out at you?
Thanks for reading, and I'm looking forward to reading your responses!</td><td>I only do machine auth, because ACLs/VLANs based on user ID is not useful in my environment.  Anything that 802.1x authenticates gets full network access, anything that is MAB'd gets a downloaded ACL since MACs can be spoofed easily.
EAP-TLS for all 802.1x unless I cannot push a cert to it - in that case I will have it PEAP with an AD username (service account, basically).
This strategy works well for us and satisfies CISO/Audit reqs.

This approach isn't that bad if you actually have your application servers and all supporting servers within their own dedicated subnet, but a lot of places will segment based on function or even will have a flat server VLAN.  In those cases this is a terrible strategy.  It is better in this instance to orchestrate a reIP of those servers, but it is also cumbersome.  
Also public IP addresses could be advertised from the Dr Data center provided the client owns their own IP block and bgp asn.  
The best Dr strategy that I've ever heard of was actually from another redditor.  I ended up putting it in a lab and I couldn't believe how great it worked.  Basically you run bgp on all of your VMs and have them peer with the top of rack switch, and then when you move them to the other Data center they can Peer with that top of rack switch and in both instances they advertise their own IP address as a slash 32 route.  This is cool because you can move a single VM or groups of VMS at the same time without worrying about weird traffic patterns, re-ips, any other annoying strategy</td><td>0.7459744335547499</td><td>0.1894144750699029</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: red"><td>To be  safe, only eat fruit and vegetables that you have grown yourself using  seeds that have been in your family for generations.</td><td>The argument goes, there was a condition on the aid, but the White House released it once they knew about the whistleblower or suspected an investigation would come.</td><td>Everything every BDS-hole should boycott but never will So your  organization has decided to boycott all products and services from  Israel. Here is a list of activities that you now need to perform in  order to comply with this boycott.
First,  remove all Intel Pentium and Celeron computer processor chips from  personal computers (desktops, laptops and notebooks) as these were  either developed or manufactured in Israel.
Note that the  revolutionary new Ivy Bridge processor will be manufactured in  Israel. Any computers running the Windows XT operating system must be  turned off immediately as this was developed in Israel. All current  Microsoft operating systems are not to be used as Microsoft is heavily  reliant on its Israel R&D centre.
**Step 2**.  Any computers that still work need to have their anti-virus software  and personal firewalls removed as this technology originated in Israel.  The organisation's firewall will also need to be switched off. Staff  should no longer open external emails as most of these will be infected  with viruses. No outgoing emails can be sent. The algorithm (code)  that's used today for sending e-mails, was made by an Israeli who worked  at the Ben-Gurion University in Be'er-Sheva in 1980.
**Step 3**.  Discard all mobile phones, as this technology was developed in Israel,  where the first mobile phones were manufactured. Mobile chip technology  from a single Israeli company has now been installed in over 100 million  devices. Only top-level staff may retain mobile phones for emergency  situations. However the use of SMS (Texting) is expressly forbidden as  this facility was developed in Israel. No 4G devices can be used, as the  chipset is Israeli.
**Step 4**. Turn off  your voice-mail service and delete any recorded messages. Israeli  companies invented the voice-mail system. If someone you do not know  answers your phone-call, then hang up. Israeli call-centres and  call-centre technology is in widespread operation in the UK.
**Step 5**.  Before accepting any printed material, check that the supplier has not  used the Israeli device that might have saved up to 50% of the ink used.
**Step 6**.  At home, do not use Facebook as many in-built and add-on applications  are Israeli-developed. Do not watch videos on the Internet as the  platform used to upload them may be from AOL and hence from an Israeli  company. Do not use the Internet to search for answers to your questions  as this may involve use of an Israeli-developed search engine. Better  to remain unenlightened.
**Step 7**. On your  TV or home entertainment centre, do not use Video On Demand (VOD) to  watch movies as you may inadvertently see an advert displayed  using Israeli software. Do not purchase any games devices as these are  likely to use Israeli technology.
**Step 8**.  Do not read books using an e-book as this may contain Israeli  technology. Do not use data storage as it may have been developed at  Israel's storage technology R&D center.
**Step 9**.  Do not buy an electric car as it is likely to be powered with  an Israeli battery or use Israeli developed charging mats. Continue to  sit in traffic knowing that you are polluting the environment and  financing oil-rich despotic regimes.
Turning to  food and drink, all food outlets on the organisation's premises must  dispose of cherry tomatoes, which were developed in Israel. Staff must  ensure that no cherry tomatoes are included in sandwiches brought into  office premises. The ban also applies to honey and any products derived  from honey. Israel has developed solutions to the worldwide problem of  bee-colony collapse, so that any products derived from bees might only  be available now due to an Israeli invention.
Avoid  drinking any of the world-recognized award-winning Israeli wines. Do not  consume homemade drinks from Israeli-manufactured household drinks  machines.
Avoid any fruit from South Africa or Peru as produce from these countries is being marketed with Israeli brand names.
No  agricultural products from the following areas must be consumed as they  use water irrigation and agricultural technology provided directly from  Israel. This includes most of Africa, China, India, Indonesia (a Muslim  country), Nepal and many others.
Much fruit and  vegetables (including organic) imported into the UK has been enhanced  using Israeli technology. This may save millions of people from starving  around the world, but is not a good reason for you to eat it. To be  safe, only eat fruit and vegetables that you have grown yourself using  seeds that have been in your family for generations.
Destroy  all personal medication. Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals, the largest  generic drugs company in the world, will have manufactured many of your  medicines.  Staff with the following illnesses will need to take  specific precautions.
Cancer – do not take any form of  medication or treatment. Israeli scientists have been working at the  forefront of oncology for decades.
AIDS and HIV – beware;  researchers at Israel's Weizmann Institute or Hebrew University  developed or improved AZT and Hypericin-based drugs; they have also  developed a treatment that destroys HIV-infected cells without damaging  healthy ones.
Diabetes – do not measure or inject Insulin using the devices developed by Israeli scientists.
Multiple  Sclerosis – stop taking Copaxone, one of the most efficient medicines  and the only non-interferon agent, as Teva developed it.  Don't  touch Laquinimod either.
Parkinson's – remove the  Israel-pioneered brain pacemaker to stop tremors. Discontinue Levodopa,  which reduces motor disturbances. Cease sessions that involve magnetic  cortex stimulation.
Staff with a family history of heart  disease and arteriosclerosis must not use the Israeli device for early  detection of these.  Rather, wait until onset of the disease.
Epileptics  – stop treatment that may have benefited from the Israeli discovery of  the underlying mutant gene; also throw away the bracelet that sends out  an alert when a person goes into seizure.
Staff or relatives with Age-related Macular Degeneration – remove Israeli implants that arrest the disease.
Liver disease – abandon Israeli-developed antibody immunotherapy treatments.
Emphysema – steer clear of the Israeli protein replacement therapy.
Myeloma – stop taking the drug Velcade, which was developed over a period of 30 years by scientists at Haifa.
Sleep apnea – no tests using the breakthrough Israeli device for diagnosis.
Dyslexics must not benefit from the Israeli Internet-based reading system.
Skin allergies must be treated with steroid creams only, as the new safer non-steroid alternative is Israeli.
Any  incident of stroke or head trauma or onset of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,  MS, epilepsy, glaucoma or brain tumor must avoid using any of the  Weizmann Institute's patented methods of treatment.
Before  any surgery or medical tests, check that hospital catheters have not  been protected from infection using the new plastic from Israel that  disables microorganisms. Avoid throat surgery as this may utilize  Israeli surgical lasers.
Ensure any colonoscopy or gastro  investigation does not use internal Israeli cameras such as the  Pillcam.  Never undergo surgery to install an artificial heart, as the  first artificial heart transplant took place in Israel.
Kidney  transplant patients must wait for donors of the same blood group as  only Israel's revolutionary new methods allow donors from other blood  groups.  Staff of Arab origin must not make use of the only database for  matching potential Arab donors of bone-marrow – in Israel.
In  the event of a spinal injury or disease, do not accept spinal  implants – likely to be an Israeli product or development. Heart rhythm  problems must not be solved with the Israeli-developed heart pulse  generator. All heart stents are off-limits as most of these originate  from Israeli medical companies.
Check all vaccines as many  of these have been developed in Israel.  Ensure that all X-rays do  carry a radiation risk, as the only radiation-free system is  Israeli.  Treatments derived from Stem Cell research must be avoided  as most of these are Israeli-developed.
If you or your  family are struck with a bacterial infection, do not take alternatives  to older, ineffective bacteria-resistant antibiotics, as an  Israeli discovery will have been responsible for the modern, effective  drugs. Check that any pain relief medication is not based on soya as an  Israeli doctor discovered the beneficial effect of the soya bean.
Do  not use the revolutionary new Israeli bandage that saved the life of  Arizona senator Gabriella Giffords after she was shot in the head.  If  you break a bone badly, reject any treatment that involves introducing  collagen, as this may have been manufactured from Israeli plants.
Do not protect babies and infants from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome with the Babysense system from Israel.
Do not use Epilady (or epilator) – two Israelis invented this hair removal device.
Finally, reject all major dental treatment, as your teeth may need to be scanned with an Israeli-developed dental scanner.
When  interviewing prospective new staff or holding meetings with members of  the public or with individuals from other companies, it is vital that  you check whether they originate from, or are associated with the  following countries and areas. You must ensure that you do not have any  contact with people who have benefited from Israel's aid to those  countries. The organization must avoid any possible acknowledgment of  Israel's contribution to world relief.   In addition, you must obtain a  formal statement from the government of these countries that Israeli aid  was not responsible for the production or development of any goods and  services supplied to the organization.

Haiti (Israel  set-up the largest field hospital to treat victims of the  2010 earthquake, the hurricane and the cholera outbreaks and provided  vital assistance for over a year)
Sri Lanka (Israel  conducted a massive airlift with food, 50 medical staff and rescue teams  only 48 hours after the Tsunami in Dec 2004)
India (Israel sent an fully-equipped field hospital following Gujarat earthquake in Feb 2001)

Venezuela (President Chavez has forgotten Israel's aid following floods of 1999)
Central America (Israel sent emergency medical aid teams and equipment to help victims of Hurricane Mitch in 1998)
Pakistan (2005) and Peru (2007) both accepted aid from Israeli NGOs following earthquake disasters.
Peru's hydro-electric power plants are also being built and run by an Israeli company.
Rawanda, Mexico, Chad,  Sudan (Darfur) and Malawi all have received humanitarian aid from  Israel, including medical assistance from Israel's NGO IsraAID.
Always  remember that the boycott extends to any individuals from the above  regions that have been exposed to Israeli assistance during the 63 years  existence of the current Jewish State.
\-Reject  all products from the USA. Analysis conducted in a typical US  stateshows that Israeli innovations were responsible for $2.4 billion in  direct revenue to that state's economy in 2009 and generated nearly  6,000 jobs.
\-Do not tutor your children in advanced  Mathematics techniques, which may have originated in Israel. Also, if  these techniques are used in your children's schools, withdraw your  children immediately.
\-Keen ornithologists should consider  giving up their hobby as many rarespecies stop off or reside in Israel  during their twice-yearly migration.
\-Do not watch the new series of NCIS as one of the actresses is Israeli.
\-Avoid going to any football matches featuring teams with Israeli players.
\-Destroy  all your recordings of Madonna, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Deep  Purple, Bon Jovie, Justin Bieber, George Benson, Moby and many, many  more artists who have ridiculed the illogical boycott and have proudly  performed (or will shortly perform) concerts in Israel.
\-Destroy  any recordings of U2, Lady Gaga, Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, Beck,  Rihanna Coldplay and any artist whose music has been recorded using  the sound technology of the Grammy Award winning Israeli company Wave  Audio. You also must get rid of any personal copies of *Shrek*,*American Beauty* and *Star Wars*. Do not trust anything recorded by Sony, JVC, Toshiba or Dell.
\-Don't go to see *The Black Swan* with Natalie Portman, or watch any old films with Elizabeth Taylor – both lovers of the Jewish State.
\-Do not stay in hotels or visit shopping centers owned by Israeli companies (sorry, you will need to check which ones yourself).
\-Do not have anything to do with the banks who are using Israeli software to prevent fraud.
\-Do  not use any credit or debit card as the Security monitoring system used  by the credit card companies is likely to be Israeli.
\-Do not buy an engagement ring containing a diamond as it is possible that this may have been cut in Israel.
\-Do not travel by air, as your plane might get towed by the Israeli-built "Taxibot."
\-Do not use public transport inside Amsterdam, Moscow or Northern Chinain case you benefit from Israeli transportation devices.
\-If  you suffer a power or network failure, be grateful that at least you  haven't installed the Israeli system that prevents power outages.
\-Finally,  you need to leave all your taps running when you leave home and must  never flush your  toilet, because Israel provides water-saving technology to over half of  the planet. It also is providing sewage treatment technology across the  world, including to the UK. It should be obvious by now that all the  measures specified in Parts 1 – 4 of this series of blogs will  inevitably mean that your organization and your staff will be completely  unable to function.  Let's therefore hope that the decision by your  organization to boycott Israeli products is flushed down the toilet of  history.

From  1966 onward Coca-Cola has been a  staunch supporter of Israel. Recently  the Government of Israel Economic  Mission honored Coca-Cola at the  Israel Trade Award Dinner for its  continued support of Israel for the  last 30 years and for refusing to  abide by the Arab League boycott of  Israel.
NESTLE
Swiss food giant Nestle will set up a   global research and development center for snack foods next year in   Sderot, a town in Israel's Negev desert, the Maariv newspaper reported   on Sunday. Nestle owns 50.1 percent of Israeli food maker Osem   Investments and the two together produce snack foods at a plant in   Sderot.
DISNEY
The Disney Company is owned by Jewish  Mogul  Michael Eisner. He owns a vast media empire that includes the  ABC  television network, numerous news dailies, national magazines,  Hollywood  film companies and a large number of radio stations. One  radio station  in Los Angeles, KABC 790 AM recently broadcast comments  by Jewess Gloria  Alred to the effect that the Islamic prisoners at  Guantanamo should be  tortured by having their "balls" extracted with  pliers in order to make  them talk. The news and commentaries made  through Michael Eisner's media  octopus are extremely Islamophobic and  anti-Palestinian.
KIMBERLY-CLARK
In 1998 Mr. Robert  P. Van der Merwe,  chairman of Kimberly-Clark Europe received the  Jubilee Award by the  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. This is the  highest tribute ever  awarded by the "State of Israel" in recognition of  those individuals and  organizations, that through their investments  and trade relationships,  have done the most to strengthen the Israeli  economy.
SARA LEE
In 1998, Mr. Lucien Nessim of Sara  Lee  Personal Products received the Jubilee Award by the Israeli Prime   Minister Netanyahu.

That wasn't interference from Obama or the CIA or any Western entity clandestine or otherwise. Is it really hard to believe that people would envisage a better economic future with the EU than with Russia?
So understandably the Ukrainian people got pissed off with such blatant denial of their right to choose their own destiny and that lead to the protests that overthrew the pro-Russian leader of Ukraine. Russia got pissed off that they were losing influence and power in Ukraine, and decided they should take Crimea. 
If Russia could set up a base and exert their influence and power in the Western hemisphere they absolutely would, and of course in the cold war they tried to numerous times with varying levels of success. Fact is though they can't, and they cannot compete with the U.S. and the West in general on an economic, cultural, or military level, not even in their own back yard let alone somewhere close to the U.S.</td><td>SCOTUS is notorious for passing on a case if they know there is a case with stronger arguments being heard that they can rule on.

The story is about a man who wants to cook some food on his stove, when he comes home in the evening after a full day of work.  In his dark hut, he uses his only source of light, a paraffin lantern, to try to locate his matches to start the fire.  He looks in his closest, opening the doors and peering inside, the lantern lighting the way.  But they are not there.
He goes to the firewood box, and opens it, using the lantern to light the innards - but the matches are not inside.
The shadows of the logs flicker on the wall as he does so.
He goes outside to the latrine - perhaps he left the matches there when he smoked his pipe yesterday?  But alas, they are not there either.
Ripples and small waves shimmer in the light of the lantern, as the pale of water is moved about to search for the small sticks.
He looks in his drawers, his coat, his cloak and all the boxes or pouches he can find in his dark hut - using the lantern to light the way.
But the matches are no where to be found.
Hungry, frustrated and tired the man goes to sleep ready for his early start and long hours tomorrow at work.
It's a semi-Buddhist tale, equivalent to "can't see the forest for the trees".
If he stopped and thought about it, his candlelight - the lantern - could have been used to start the stove.  If he knew the candlelight was fire, the meal would have been cooked much earlier in the day, and he would have been satisfied when he slept, and been fresh for work tomorrow.
If you immediately know the candlelight is fire, then the meal was cooked a long time ago.
[EDITS: spelling and embellishment of the tale, if I'm honest.]</td><td>50dB is roughly normal ambient noise in a typical house. With exposure over sufficient time, above 70dB can cause damage (70dB is about the level of the average office), but 95dB is where it starts being painful for most people with normal hearing, and from that point, as it gets louder, permanent hearing damage occurs more rapidly.
I would get a free noise meter app for your phone, and start measuring when he cranks it past 11. If your phone is Apple or Samsung, the numbers should be pretty accurate; some phones use an automatic gain control on the microphone which can cause the readings to be pretty inaccurate. Occasional spikes up to 70dB or 75dB are pretty normal, but sustained noise above 70 is probably enough to break the CC&R; above 80dB sustained I think would definitely run afoul of the rules.
Record dates and times along with readings. If you can record video of each event, including the readout of the noise meter app, it might make it apparent to the HOA that this is a real problem. Do it each time and send it right away to the HOA.</td><td>0.7459758036593964</td><td>-0.0503210086362588</td><td>7</td></tr>

Obviously the FBI investigation has been well documented but lots of this other stuff was new to me. I clicked on a few of the sources for some of the more salacious allegations and they were either not backed up by the source or much weaker than the article alleges. I have no idea whether Gaetz is the person this article alleges but I do know this is a hit piece.
> In an incident from 2012, Gaetz and some of his legislator bros got drunk at a Disney resort and made a loud scene in the lobby. He attempted to bribe the front desk attendant with $20 to get access to another guest's room.
The ultimate source for this is here. It alleges that Gaetz was one of many who were there but the assertion that he is the one who did this seems to be made up by the Medium author.
> However, in this case the arresting officer was forced to resign in lieu of being fired in an "unrelated" matter within a week of Gaetz's arrest. The judge then quietly dismissed all charges. He somehow even avoided the suspended license. It's good to have a dad who's a leading state senator. 
Those scare quotes around "unrelated" and the last sentence certainly read like Gaetz and his Dad got this officer fired to make a problem go away. What does the actual article cited tell us?
> On Nov. 10, Anglin made a DUI arrest in Destin. An internal affairs report said that Anglin grabbed the suspect around the neck after he believed the suspect spit on him. But three other deputies, including a trainee, were there as well, and said the spitting was unintentional and that Anglin used unreasonable force. An internal affairs report agreed.
> According to Anglin's personnel file, this was his fourth infraction, and third in a year.
Now it certainly seems like Gaetz should have been charged and convicted, but it's hard to do that when the arresting officer has been fired for repeated misconduct.
> They recalled one incident of him making jokes about hiring strippers for a Super Bowl party he organized. 
A joke about strippers? Scandalous!
> Two sources, including a Republican state representative who served alongside Gaetz in the Florida House in 2014–15, have accused Matt Gaetz of coming up with a sex game when he served in the state legislature.
I have no idea whether this is true, but the source of it seems to be a Twitter feud between him and another state legislator where the other guy references a tweet that claims an anonymous source for this. Weak.
> It turned out there was an incomprehensible plot to defraud the Gaetz's out of $25 million...If your head is spinning in disbelief, that's the appropriate response. None of that made a lick of sense. 
You'd think an article published 4 days after the extortionist pleaded guilty to extortion would mention this fact rather than write paragraphs about how far-fetched the plot was. Obviously the Biden DOJ, which accepted the plea and wrote a press release about it, finds the story to make sense despite the author's incredulity. The failure to mention this plea removes any shred of credibility this author might have had. 
> He was a congressman in his late 30s who had never been married or even romantically associated with anyone. I think it's fair to say that many assumed he was gay. After all, being a Republican in an ultra-conservative district, that's the kind of thing you might want to keep quiet. I mean his colorful suits and immaculate hair just screamed closeted homosexual.
Is it actually OK to just assume people are probably gay because they are single, dress well, and have good hair? I've seen the left lob these accusations at others (like Lindsay Graham) and I can't help but feel like this would be considered homophobic if the right did it.
I could go on, but it's tiring to try to fact-check this stuff given the author's twisting.

But I didn't have a clue how.
That's when I heard about a national organization that promoted "investment clubs", offering support and tools to help people like me learn about investing by *doing* it. I liked the idea – get smarter, play low stakes, and maybe have a beer or two while you do it. So I told a few friends, they talked to their friends, and pretty soon, we had a budding investment club.
Since we were all friends of friends, organizing went smoothly. We elected officers and adopted a simple charter, based on the national group's templates. Minimum monthly dues were set at $10, an amount any one of us could afford to throw away. But any member could contribute more than the minimum if they liked and, to build up our investing pot, most of us did. Individual contributions bought "shares" in the club's holdings, like stock in a corporation. Higher contributions meant more shares meant more voting power when we made club decisions.
As we got rolling, a few more people heard about the club and expressed interest. So we created a little process: Attend three meetings as the guest of a member. Then, if you're still interested, club members decide whether to offer an invitation. We always did. Sign the charter, pay this month's dues, and you're in. Most new members paid extra for at least a while, to catch up to the voting power of the founding members. So everyone stood on more or less equal footing.
By year two, we had settled into a friendly routine, holding monthly meetings that were one part socializing, one part learning, and one part considering what to do with our growing little pot of cash. We picked a few stocks, starting buying a few shares at a time, and portfolio performance was added to the monthly treasurer's report. We cheered each modest gain and learned from our small losses.
Then came Pat.
Pat was an outlier in our friend group. Most of us knew her, but few knew her well. She had a reputation for being a little too loud, a little too blunt, a little too cocky, a little too rude. But she was also known to be smart. In a club focused on learning, more smart couldn't hurt, right? Besides, our well-respected President had brought her in.
And right away, Pat proved she *was* smart. She had reviewed our charter and our past minutes before she came to her first meeting. She asked solid questions about past decisions and our reasoning. She listened respectfully to the education and stock study presentations, probing politely, and made mostly appreciative comments after each meeting. Just a bit of smart-ass thrown in once in a while, but we could handle a bit.
After her third meeting, we sent her to the next room while we discussed inviting her to join us. There were a few misgivings expressed – we had all heard stories about Pat's capacity for unpleasantness, after all. But President said, "I warned her pretty bluntly that she needs to behave when she's here. We're all friends, but this is business. Money is serious. So I told her, keep yourself in check. Leave your attitude outside." Ultimately, everyone agreed, she had indeed behaved. We had no reason to doubt her sincere interest.
So we called Pat back in and President said, "Congratulations, Pat. Just pay your dues and sign here." With a flourish, Pat handed Treasurer a $10 bill, and everyone applauded as she signed the charter.
Then she said, "Thank you, all, thank you. But frankly, you really don't have any way to keep me out."
The room got quieter.
Then she turned to Treasurer and said, "Now, next month, if I'm interpreting your little reports correctly, all I have to do is give you $XXX and I'll have equal voting rights, is that right?"
"And then I'd be in charge of all club decisions," declared Pat. "That's right. Unless you all can keep ponying up more cash than I can, there's nothing you can do to stop me from running this club like my own private account with nearly double my money to play with, is there? And now that I've signed your silly charter, you don't even have any way to kick me out. So, see you all next month."
She smirked, turned and left. The door had just barely closed when the room exploded.
"How big a mistake did we just make?"
But as we looked over our template-based charter, we found she was right. There were requirements for tax reporting, officer fiscal responsibilities, bank and brokerage relationships, conflicts of interest ... and a host of other issues we'd never faced and never expected to face. There was boilerplate language about how to buy out a voluntarily withdrawing member. There was a provision allowing us to involuntarily withdraw someone who didn't keep up with dues and/or attendance.
But we had no cap on individual member contributions and no provision allowing us to kick out a stakeholder so long as they continued to pay their dues and attend meetings. And we now realized that if she could make good on her threat to buy majority holding, Pat could simply outvote any attempt to amend our charter.
A more elegant solution probably existed, but within 20 minutes, someone came up with the nuclear option. Two minutes later, we agreed to launch it. We accepted assignments, then went our separate ways to prepare for next month's meeting.
That evening, everyone arrived a bit more promptly and settled a lot more quietly than usual. Pat looked smug as she took a seat, seeming not to care that no one spoke to her. She was ostentatiously fanning herself with a personal check. Too bad we never saw it, so we'll never know if she really was ready to put her money where her loudmouth had been.
President took the floor. "Before I call the meeting to order, I have a personal announcement to make. I made a really poor recommendation to all of you last month. I feel the bad judgment I showed means I am not fit to be your president. I'm presenting my letter of resignation and my voluntary withdrawal from the club." And solemnly gave the letter to Secretary.
Pat looked like she'd been slapped, but she said nothing.
Treasurer spoke up. "Just so you all know, President spoke to me earlier about this decision, so I've already calculated withdrawal payout and have it ready, according the terms of our charter." And President took the check.
Vice President spoke next. "President, you weren't alone in that decision. I voted with you and I also regret my poor judgment. Here is my letter of resignation and withdrawal."
Treasurer said, "And here is your withdrawal payout, prepared as we discussed."
And on it went. In small clusters at first, then all in a rush, each club member declared they'd made a terrible decision, presented a letter and collected an already prepared check. Sometime during the rush, Pat stopped being silent.
But we didn't. With all the letters collected, Secretary added them to the back of a fat binder containing copies of all the club minutes, and gave the binder to Pat. "Your next club secretary will need this."
Treasurer was right behind with a similar binder of financial records, a $10 bill on top. "Here are all your club's accounting records and remaining assets."
President added the signed charter to the stack. "So, Pat, looks like you're now a club of one. You win. Good luck. And good bye." We all stood and stared silently until she shoved the stack to the floor and saw herself, sputtering, to the door.
Within 10 minutes, we had signed our newly upgraded charter, re-elected our officers, torn up all our payout checks, and put our "new" club back to business as usual. OK, maybe just a bit more giggly and a little more pleased with ourselves than usual.
Never saw Pat again. Didn't care.

Our Powers-That-Be sent out a Staff-All email reminding us that Today, the third Tuesday in September, was ostensibly "National IT Professionals Day."  Anyone that could be arsed to come to the atrium at 3PM would be celebrated with that next-best-thing-than-more-money: Vanilla and Orange ice cream cups, the kind with the wooden paddles!  Those of us at the helpdesk had our own reason to be celebrating, however.  Pointy Haired Dennis had given the team the best gift any manager of his caliber possibly could; their resignation.  He was leaving Undistinguished State University for the glistening fields of Coney Island Community College (Go Whitefish!).  We were observant to see him go. Through some miracle, the significance of which escaped the attention of our Powers-That-Be, those of us left behind in the field team were able to provide exactly the same level of service to our customers as when Dennis had been at the helm.
Dennis, whose advanced technical knowledge can not be quantified.  Who insisted all technicians doing on-site visits were to fill out a form collecting data easily queried from Active Directory.  Who stole my fucking chair while I was out of town for a close relative's funeral.  He maintained that I must have recorded the asset tag incorrectly followed by playing the "well, I'm the boss" card when I pointed out the hidden spot where I'd sharpied my name.
Academic support hierarchies abhor a vacuum; despite Montana's month in charge being one of the most productive ever, a replacement manager was hired externally.  His name was Duckhunt and his management style gave us whiplash.  Dennis was a micromanager to the extreme.  Unfortunately, he never bothered to keep his skills current enough to be at all useful for implementation details.  That didn't stop him from trying, though!  Duckhunt, in contrast, just told us what to do and maybe gave a couple hints about what ways he thought we could go, based on his experience and reading of tech magazines.  He also insisted on having weekly meetings with all the senior technicians.
Duckhunt, having made an over the top checking of his watch over 45 seconds ago, began loudly coughing and rustling the papers on his clipboard to call us to order.
We were under the impression that Duckhunt had been in the military at some point, although I'm not sure if that was actually true or just something we started telling ourselves.  Either way, he was good at quelling rabble.
He flipped through his clipboard.  The smell of coffee flooded the cube as he extracted an unfortunate inkjet print-out that once held a work history.
Montana glared across the cube at me.
>**Duckhunt:**  Well he's several thousand bubbles of nobody now.  I'm assuming we have his email somewhere?
He noticed our less than enthusiastic faces.
Montana shot a look at me and RollerDarby.
The three of us gave a thumbs down with a raspberry.
>**Montana:**  Probably the worst candidate we've ever brought in.  Didn't you hear any of that interview?
>**Montana:**  Well, he rolled in here with the personality of a fart at a party.
>**RollerDarby:**  He has strongly held strange opinions on how the plot of Harry Potter should've played out and felt the need to express them.  Repeatedly.  During an interview.
>**Bluecoat:**  I asked him to describe a time he'd had a conflict at work and he told a story about how he'd been fired from Fred Meyer's for slamming a cart into the side of a customer's car.
Going angry on a customer is like going angry on a small human.  If that's one of your traits, perhaps your career path shouldn't involve a metaphorical or literal daycare.
>**Montana:**  It took forever to get him through the support scenarios.  He kept arguing that nobody talks like that and he knew that we'd made all of the scenarios up.
>**Duckhunt:** Was he unaware that this is a world of magical realism, often populated by huge hams and improbable situations?
>**Bluecoat:** One of the scenarios has a damn ape arguing technical topics like a cartoon coyote and abuse of metaphor that'd earn a free trip through the buffet after a Bulwer-Lytton contest.  He didn't take the hint.
Scrumpling the paper off his clipboard, Duckhunt competently yet unremarkably sunk a three-pointer into the novelty basketball hoop someone had hung over the technician's pen trashcan years ago.  The crowd went mild.
Duckhunt, as part of his incoming activities, had started an audit of our books and review of active projects.  He was now responsible for them and had the fair expectation that they at a minimum blend in with objective reality if one squinted.
>**Duckhunt:**  So Bluecoat, what can you tell me about this "Comprehensive Inventory Project" that Dennis was championing?
>**Bluecoat:**  Couple-'o-months back, Dennis goes to see that psychic over on Ninth.  She does a Tarot reading and whatever she tells him he interprets into the universe saying that we didn't know enough about our customer's systems.  So he made up this form for our field techs to fill out during visits and had me horseshit up an Access database to put it in.
I grabbed a fresh form from the pocket file mounted on the cubical wall and handed it to him.  He read over it and frowned.
>**Duckhunt:** He had you guys taking down hostnames, IP address, MAC address, memory, disk free, Windows version...  Doesn't Active Directory already do all this automatically?
Duckhunt winced.
>**Duckhunt:**  So he was wasting our field techs time collecting data we already had and wasting your time doing data entry.
Montana, RollerDarby, and I exchanged confused looks.  This was the first manager we'd ever had that actually was concerned about tying their underlings to boondoggles.  Montana took a chance and clued him in.
>**Bluecoat:**  And the 'Inventory Database' I made for him is just an Access front-end that queries Active Directory with a bit of filtering to only show the users we support.
>**Duckhunt:**  Right, we'll just cancel that project and never speak of it again.  Ok, next on my list, it says here we spent $1000 on DVD burners?
I flipped through the stack of papers on my clipboard.
>**Bluecoat:**  Sorry, these are blank.  Look, I'm reasonably sure we haven't had any burners come through here recently.
>**Duckhunt:**  Here's the purchase order.  It says it was purchased for the Public Health department?
Sure enough, it listed a pair of *nice* 6X speed drives, external with a firewire interface, and enough blanks to keep them fed for a good long time.  Weirdly, the justification field just said "Purchase for Public Health Dept." No specific customer or room and it had been billed to our cost center.
>**Bluecoat:**  I don't see how this PO got processed, there's no end-user and we absolutely do not do purchasing on behalf of departments.
>**Bluecoat:**  Unlikely.  We'd've noticed the helpdesk goons spending all their time making "backups" and making up bullshit excuses to get more blanks ordered.
>**Duckhunt:**  Point taken.  Alright, can you do some due diligence this week and check around with Public Health just to make sure they're not just-
**We now return to STAFF MEETING, already in progress**
>**Bluecoat:**  -they're not just sitting in a box anywhere over there.  I also checked with the dean, the office staff, and their media department.
We'd trained our users well.
>**Bluecoat:** So we have a paper trail that begins and ends with Dennis and him ignoring a well-known department policy.  Is there anyone here that believes Dennis didn't just rip this shit off on his way out the door?
>**Duckhunt:** No, BigBoss told me to try to track them down and if not, we can just mark them in inventory as lost.  She was explicit that we didn't need to worry about filing a...
A flickering lightbulb reflected off the top of his head as he achieved enlightenment.
Duckhunt let out a heavy sigh and uncapped a black sharpie.
>**Duckhunt:**  You know what?  Not my circus, not my monkeys.  I'll just go ahead and cross that off the to-do list.  We will speak of it even less than the other thing.  Meeting adjourned, go away!
*A rollicking, synth-heavy soundtrack fires up as RollerDarby flounces into the cube.  She slaps the day's edition of the USU student paper on the desk.*

Dennis cut her off, having already spotted the surname on her lanyard-dangling photo-ID.

Had some success with this using CSR1000v to do DMVPN with onprem ISR's, but getting just spoke to spoke working reliably has been difficult and I've all but given up on using the cloud as a DMVPN Hub. I need to review [user] 's links, hopefully I'll pick something up because otherwise hybrid cloud has been a pain and it feels ham-fisted trying to use things like virtual routers in cloud. Lots of dirty NAT's to force it into working the way you would onprem. Vnet to Vnet DMVPN is one of those hackey ways to force cloud to behave like onprem while lining Cisco's wallet. There are other "multicloud" options that work similarly under the hood because it's almost the only way to do it. Native tooling works better / is better integrated to cloud but is lacking when it comes to talking to onprem and other clouds, particularly when you'd like to interconnect using private WAN to give yourself options because anyone who's worth their salt has trust issues with the internet. The rock & hard place I keep running into is cloud to cloud over middlemile(L3VPN or VPLS with managed expressroute/directconnect landings in the underlay, etc) while encrypting everything between cloud to cloud and cloud to onprem to satisfy InfoSec/TheAuditors. The solution seems to be a DMVPN over the top but then I still have problems with device level fault detection / route propagation between my WAN and the L3 "switch" in each cloud. AzureRouteServer ought to help here, but last I knew it was still in beta. I think TransitGateway in AWS can do similar but havn't finished confirming my understanding of it. At the end of the day all this gets you is a traditional DMVPN with circa \~2010 management and relies on your routing protocol to detect and handle brownouts. SDWAN / multicloud options that integrate with things like AzureRouteServer have some promise, but I haven't confirmed they'd support using expressroute/directconnect as an underlay and their documentation diagrams don't indicate it as an option..
This link helped me get a CSR working over internet & private WAN;
The smart network dumb app approach that's traditionally been onprem doesn't work well in cloud but we're frequently told to move dumb apps up to the cloud regardless. When DR is restore this replica in another region but the app can't handle being re-IP'd without also being reinstalled the DR plan turns into "rebuild x app" and management doesn't like that answer.
At the end of the day it strikes me as a mismatch of requirements and capabilities, but ultimately mangelment says "go to the cloud!" because ExecWeekly said so and feels good about themselves moving the compute expense from the capital to the operational column of the budget sheet (even though it costs more since it's on 24/7 and doesn't scale) and we're left to deal with the fallout with our arms tied behind our backs.</td><td>My legendary dog strat (silver) Managed to catch all three dogs within a few hours yesterday and wanted to share my strategy in case it helps anyone else.

It was a bird I'd not gotten to see yet, on loan for a big op the following evening.  The aircrew was also out of Bagram and had never gotten their engines washed by our crew so there was an opportunity to do a bit of teaching for the crew.
SSG CrewChief was a rather warm and friendly southerner, and was quite willing to learn.  That made the job, already an easy and enjoyable one, even more fun for me.  
The process for washing a CH47 engine was pretty straightforward.  On the side of the Chinhook below the engine on each side was a quick disconnect to which I would attach one of two pressurized cylinders.  The first would be a water/soap mixture, the second was rinse water.  The Crew Chief's job was to run the APU and turn the engine while I operated the wash cart.  The Crew Chief would start the spin, I would open the valve for a number of seconds, and then I would close the valve and announce that over the headsets to the Crew Chief who would motor the engine for a few more minutes before shutting it down.  (Motoring an engine is supplying start air to turn it, but not turning on the fuel and ignition.  There's a certain duty cycle you have to maintain for time of spinning the engine in this way, because otherwise you risk burning out the starter.)  I would then disconnect my soap line, drive the gator to the other side of the helicopter and we would repeat the process.  
As soon as the second engine was soaped up and soaking, I would drive back to the first engine and then dismount to allow it to soak for another couple minutes, hook up our download computer to the DECU (Digital Engine Control Unit) for the FADEC (Full-Authority Digital Engine Control---basically a fancy electronic suite to run the engine efficiently) and download the DECU's data and log files.  Once completed, the soak would be over and we would repeat the process, this time using rinse water.  
It was a fun duty that let us get out and talk to our customers and see the birds and out from the ever-watchful eye of our squad leader.  I spent a little bit of time talking to SSG Crewchief before I packed up my gear and made my way back to the shop.
The next morning, I found myself at 644 again, which had moved since I last had seen it to sit in front of our spare clamshell, a place it would soon call home for a couple months.  I was on the hunt for one of our Technical Inspectors, and had been told he was out here.  Indeed he was, helping out another younger mechanic who was working on it.
He tossed me a fuel filter bowl from the #2 engine.  
I looked it over, and it appeared one of the wild cats of Kandahar had attacked it.
I fetched them their replacement filter bowl, got my paperwork signed and wandered off again.
Late that afternoon, a massive airlift took off, numerous aircraft carrying a load of infantry to the Sangin Valley in Helmand Province—the operation the on-loan Chinook was here for.  I'm not sure what exactly was going on, other than standard infantry ground-pounding.  
Late in the evening, I felt the urge to leave my room and take a walk, so I stepped out of our barracks and took in the wonderful Kandahar night air.  I noticed there was a group of people standing in the road nearby, talking in urgent and hushed tones, so I went over to them to find out what was going on.  The person speaking, it turns out, was my doppleganger—a Chinook inspector who's name was, aisde from his middle, identical to mine.  I asked him what was going on.
His voice got quiet.
I was shocked.  We were all shocked.  This crew I'd just met was gone in a blink of an eye.  I know one never expects to lose an aircrew, even though this was war, so it hurt pretty badly.  
At that point the story goes that the infantry had been pushed off the crash site by Taliban forces, and only retook the wreckage once given additional support from Special Forces.  I have no idea if this is what really happened, but our Detachment CO (Our company XO), Captain America, wanted our DART (Downed Aircraft Recovery Team) to be prepared to be called on to secure the crash site.   From what I understand he even gave the Lord Farquadt speech (Some of you may die...) and was getting all psyched to go before being told to stand down.  
Besides, a DART is pretty much pointless when the helicopter you're being sent to recover is spread  out over several hundred yards.
A couple days later we held a memorial for the five crewmen of Aircraft 644, Callsign Flipper 75.  That evening was the Ramp Ceremony where we sent our friends back home one last time.  They and their passengers, a Canadian combat photographer and a British Military Policeman were loaded aboard a C17 to the heart-wrenching bagpipes of the Canadians crying out with the song *Amazing Grace*.
 A number of weeks later, a half dozen Jingle Trucks rolled up to our spare clamshell, their cargo a load of dirt and debris.  A DoD investigation team of Civilians came out and took control of the clamshell, and we learned the contents of those Jingle Dumps were the remains of 644 and a whole lot of dirt.  It turns out that after recovery, the locals contracted with the duty drove over to a local FOB and dumped it all into a trash pit, which required us to scoop everything up, dirt and all, to bring back for reconstruction.  
We all took our turns helping with the efforts, putting the engine pieces in their places (the new filter bowl was still shiny...) or manning the sifting screens.  Of note for me, I discovered in my turn on the sifter an airspeed indicator still locked in at their speed upon impact, and the clasp end of the monkey harness one of the crewchiefs had been wearing.  
After that, I couldn't do it anymore and never returned to help reconstruct the helicopter.
Every now and again, I would look up what happened to 644, to remember and to see if any new information came out.  A couple years ago, a revelation in the story was made that made me furious.
When 644 went down, we were told it was several RPGs impacting it in the nose and auxiliary fuel tanks.  It made a sort of sense—those helicopters wouldn't take much to take out, and a pair of RPGs would do nicely.  However, it turns out that was a cover.
What actually had happened was the Taliban had a MANPAD in the area, a weapon we were never told they had.  I don't know that the knowledge would have changed anything, but, it still feels like a sort of betrayal.

McKay tweaked the Asurans' base code to crank up their inter-cell attraction (via FRAn), pulling cells from their fancy new warships down to the replicator cell mega-mass down on the planet. Eventually, the combination of their neutronium structure and the increased density from the base code tweak caused the mass to become dense enough to sink into the planet's core and displace its own core, which caused the planet to explode. The sun was unaffected.
The sad thing is that the planet exploded so quickly that nobody could sieze the now-empty Asuran cruisers before they too were destroyed.</td><td>0.7879452889894336</td><td>0.0429011728347297</td><td>8</td></tr>

Edit: So that happened.</td><td>Your mom is a JN, big-time. As others in the comments have said, mom isn't a "soft place to land", she's a concrete pit with metal spikes -- *stay away*. Your husband is trying to protect his new family from one who clearly wants to cause damage to it, if not outright destruction (i.e. your mother). You and hubby are a team now -- stick together no matter what she tries to do. Your husband is revealing his shiny spine and is trying to do his job to protect you from JNMom's machinations -- put on your sunglasses and hang on, cuz it's going to be a helluva ride.
> I feel like she's saying "I know you're going to get divorced one day, but don't worry, I'll be here for you when that happens."
That's *exactly* what she's saying, and even hoping for. Worst case, *she'll try to bring that prophecy to fulfillment* through her manipulations, just to maintain her control over you. She will try to pit you against hubby; *do not fall into the trap*. You say you don't want to rock the boat. It's understandable, but you *need* to flip that boat over and *throw her out of it*. Do everything you and hubby can to get out of her house and into your own place as quickly as possible. You're freaking out and mad at hubby, even though you agree in principle with what he said.  That's what *she* wants, though -- you angry at *him* instead of *her* over what *she* did wrong. *That's the trap*. Let your anger at him subside, because he did what was necessary at the moment. Your husband is not the enemy here; he's your greatest ally. I think you know that, but years of indoctrination from the *real* enemy have you reacting knee-jerk. Suppress the brainwashing and look at it rationally.
Set those boundaries, set clear penalties, and *stick to them*. If you have trouble doing it, let your husband run interference -- it seems like he's already getting into the battle here, and I think he's up to the task. Until you're strong enough to get all the way out of the FOG, let him be the bad guy (as far as mom is concerned), but don't let him do it alone; *stick with him* -- he's going to need your support. Don't let your mom tear the two of you apart.
> EDIT: I did confront her after the rent thing to let her know I thought we had agreed on just utilities, and she did back down, but it was in that moment we realized some weird dynamics were at play.
Excellent! You stood to her up in a relatively simple matter, and *you won*. Let that build some confidence in yourself. You also begin to see how things are going to start playing out, so be prepared for bigger and harder battles. Take it one battle at a time, one day at a time, and let hubby help -- that's one of the things we husbands are there for in our marriages. Don't get complacent -- get ready for the next encounter.
I'll echo what others have already said -- get some counseling to help you clear the FOG. And above all else, *talk with your husband*. He is there for you, just as much as you are there for him. He seems to have the strength you need right now to get clear -- use it, and eventually you will have your own strength and the confidence to use it.
I know that science-fiction is not everyone's cup of tea, and especially not Star Trek. But there's an episode of Deep Space Nine that I think is worth a watch (season 6, episode 7, "You Are Cordially Invited") -- Worf and Jadzia's wedding ceremony in the last few minutes of the episode. I think it shows a picture of what you and your new husband need to be in your current situation -- a united force fighting against all who would destroy you (i.e. your mother and any flying monkeys she sends your way), watching each other's backs, and picking each other up when something knocks you or hubby down. This *will* be a battle, and you need to be ready to fight it. You have already noticed the problems, and you agree with what hubby wrote. You just need the confidence in both him and the two of you together, and the strength to break through a lifetime of mom's programming.</td><td>0.7879472562219033</td><td>-0.004671244767477</td><td>8</td></tr>

Today i bring you a short tale of my wonderful end users. 
EU: End User
I log in for my normal day and receive my normal morning tickets. Software installs, breakfix and troubleshooting. You know, typical stuff. 
I see a software request for something pretty basic. Easily deployed through SCCM. I add the user to the group and give it the pre-req 20 minutes and reach out to the user
Me: Hi *user* I got your ticket to get *software* installed. If you have a moment today, open your windows menu and search for "Software Center". In there you should see the icon for *software* click on it and then click on INSTALL and it will install. If you need any help please let me know!
About 30 minutes later I get a response:
EU: Hi Obvious, i have looked up and down in the windows menu and i cannot find anything called the software center, please help. 
Not a problem. User is new-ish to our company and probably hasn't even seen the software center. I ping them on Lync
Me: Hi *EU* if you open your windows menu and just type in "Software" it should show up right away. 
Eu: I don't see a place to type. are you sure?
EU: Obvious, i really don't understand. there isn't a place to type. 
Eh, screw it. I walk up to the user's floor and to their desk. They see me coming and drop their head. 
EU: I swear i'm not *that* bad with computer, but typing in that menu doesn't make sense. there isn't a place to type. 
I laugh it off and take the wheel and open the windows menu and type "Software Center" and it shows up immediately.
I'll spare some of the language, but the user was completely blown away by this newest revelation. They now brag to me how they impress everyone around them with their genius knowledge of Windows. 
I love my End Users.</td><td>I dealt with something vagely similar a few years ago. Had a used car dealership with a location in Fairbanks and another in Anchorage, and they wanted to buy websites from us, one per location. An important part of the website was getting the dealer's inventory on the site, including photos of the cars, VIN, features, options, yadda yadda.
Most customers could just send us a CSV export directly from their dealer management system, sometimes tab- or pipe-separated (and occasionally XML, ugh, I hated those) -- no problem, I had loads of existing code to deal with all of that, automated, as long as the export arrived by the time the import ran, Bob's your uncle.
This pair of dealers, however, ran an ADP system, which consisted of some sort of minicomputer running at each location, with a web interface which simply stuck a terminal emulator into a web page, green text and all. But they could export their data as a text file, so they sent it to me to look at.
This was not CSV. It was not tab-separated. It was not pipe-separated. Hell, it wasn't even XML. It was simply grouped lines of text, with control characters embedded (sprinkled about the file liberally). Each group had the same type of information, but it wasn't consistent -- the lines of information were not in the same order from record to record, the installed options were not in any sort of cohesive pattern and didn't consistently use common terms for features, and you might not even get the same number of lines in each record. There were significant issues with this file structure.
So we contacted ADP to see about getting a nice CSV export set up from the dealers. There was already an Excel file export on the web terminal page, so we figured a CSV export would be quick and easy, maybe even a feature that already existed and simply needed turned on.
ADP wanted to charge us fifty thousand dollars for them to write the CSV export.
The final import script I wrote simply extracted the VIN, mileage, and sale price from each record, and hit up our VIN lookup system for the rest.</td><td>0.7879490277286203</td><td>0.0657033236491106</td><td>8</td></tr>

So, with Mikasa breaking the chain, Ymir can also be free.
2. Yeah, I'm cool with that. It's a nice character moment for the final part of the story.
3. There are many reasons why he got it. It crippled Marley by losing one of the more powerful Titans. He used the Warhammer's power to hide himself and Zeke in the Founder. He uses it to construct the weapons and Titans to defend himself.
4. What are you talking about? Eren's talking about how he's gonna kill them all and it'll be his fault they died. He's trying to be determined.
5. So she can kill him.
6. He WANTED to lose. That was part of the plan. He'd lose so the others would be seen as heroes.
7. It's not insane plot armor cause these people have survived a lot already. The fan service is perfectly fine and it fit the story. Plus, it's the final episode, so a little fan service is fine.
8. So past Eren could have a reason to join the Scouts so he can become a Titan so he could get to the basement so he can figure out what the plan is
9. Eren's goal was to keep the outside world from attacking Paradis. That was the main goal of his plan. It worked for a little while but whatever happens next is out of his hands.
10. I am very cool with that line. Seeing Eren act pathetic and be sincere about his love for Mikasa that he's been neglecting for years is a good character moment. It makes him human.</td><td>Past. The avatar universe has a democracy and technology problem that will eventually cause the avatar and bending to become obsolete. I'd be fine with doing 1 more series on the next avatar who has to deal with these issues, maybe just 1 season. If they're really dead set on going into the future, I'd even be okay with an apocalypse level event, but I think that would be too dark for an avatar story. The Avatar universe functions at its best in a feudal system with limited technology. Personally, I'd like to see a series about the second avatar. This would allow for more lore building/fixing, and an idea that I had is; Wan was not trained by master benders, he was given his bending by the turtles. This would also only be 1 generation into bending being accessible to the masses, so there are most likely little to no masters of any element. Have this avatar go to the "original bending animals" to learn the elements, and become a teaching avatar who goes to the other nations showing how to learn from the animal benders to master their respective element. This would also be an opportunity to tell an avatar story where the concept of the avatar is not wildly known in universe. I'd love to see it in the Wan art style too. But that's just my opinion.</td><td>0.7879503673742438</td><td>0.1006130324814824</td><td>8</td></tr>

When Leia sends the message to Obi Wan in new hope, she is saying that she needs him to once again be a soldier as he was in the clone wars. She is guilt tripping him to action for the rebellion -- not only for Leia. 
I agree that if ANH was made now, she'd prob say something about her rescue, but I don't think it's necessary for her to mention it. 
Also, she might not even know her current rescuer is Obi Wan, she only knows him as Ben -- she might not realize that connection. 
Obi and Leia also never meet in ANH, so there's no direct way to tell if they've met before. 
As for Vader, in ANH he says it's a feeling he's "not felt since...", That only means since last they met which could be any time. 
Then later he says "when I left you I was but a learner, now I am the master" -- again, he doesn't say since we last met, he says since I left you, which is when he became Vader in the first place and says nothing on if they met in-between. It implies the relative growth over Obi Wan that he has achieved 
I'm sure this isn't exactly what the writers originally intended, but the Kenobi series just changes how those lines hit. It does not make them inconsistent, in fact I think it deepens them perhaps
Another good point from the comments: Obi wan says "He's more machine then man" in ROTJ not having directly met with Vader during the OT. Obi wan wouldn't know he was a cyborg or anything about his current state had they not met during Kenobi. 
It was also pointed out that Leia did actually hear Obi Wan's name in the show (tbf I watched them a while ago), so she should know who he is in new hope. Still, doesn't invalidate the rest of my argument. Especially since they never meet in new hope. 
At the end of day, I want to love Star Wars and this show has been a nice addition on the whole. Same goes for Mando and Boba shows.

I've never questioned this, but it dawned on me that, to my knowledge, the subject of a portrait can travel between their frames, but leave said portrait empty when gone, and is only in 1 portrait at a time. But does this mean that the Dumbledore in all the chocolate frogs is the same, that there is only 1, and he needs to jump between them all? Ron says "I got about 6 of him" which makes me assume he is a common card. All of this leads me to believe Harry was very lucky to even see Dumbledore on the card at all as he opened his chocolate frog.</td><td>0.7879567801338748</td><td>0.2692808537175795</td><td>8</td></tr>

Hi, this is my very first post on reddit, so please, don't be too harsh on me. :) Also, I am from Germany and not quite sure I translated the position titles correctly, but if not, they're mostly minor detail to the story. And I know most of this story is explanation about the relationship, but I think it's necessary to get what happened.
 I (43 F) am a learned landscape gardener, but due to an accident many years ago, can no longer work the actual craft. In 2020, after 12 years of being a STAHM, I began working in the office of a quite large landscaping firm. My position was Assistant to Management, with „Jack", one of the COOs, as my direct boss. At the time, I did mostly supporting paperwork. A couple of months later, the company hired „Becky" as a junior manager. She had just finished her master's degree, and this was her first „real" job, so she had a LOT to learn, and to gain experience. In the beginning, she relied on me for the paperwork and how our programs worked, and I thought we got along well, even though we were as different as two people can be. 
In spring 2021, there were some changes made. For once, our whole department moved to new office rooms, and Becky and I were put in the same office. Also, I was taken out of day-to-day-paperwork to work exclusively on surveying, to get all the measurements needed to correctly bill our clients. About that time, our problems started. I am on the ADHD spectrum, so I have habits of unconciously fiddling, or talking to myself, and other stuff, that unnverved her. She needed absolute quiet while working, whereas I prefer to hear music over headphones. Everytime she told me something I did would disturb her, I tried to stop myself from doing that, be it mumbling, listening to music while she is in the office, even drinking coffee because „your slurping is disgusting". (Coffee is hot, duh?) I was not allowed to comment on anything concerning her (I am a terribly curious person), and so on. Even though I love my job and anyone else in the company, that daily repression made me not want to go to work in the morning. 
It came to afist head when one of our foremen was in the office. She gave him a task, he was annoyed, and I made a fun little comment that made the foreman chuckle (lightened his mood as intended). But after he'd left, she exploded on me how dare I undermine her authority, and how unrespecting of her position and person I was, after all SHE was a manager (junior, but who counts?), and I was merely the assistant. She went to Jack to complain about me, how she could not work with me when I was so obnoxious, yadda yadda... Long story short, Jack is a super chill boss, he talked to me to hear my side, and three days later I moved all my stuff into another, smaller office, where I work ever since. 
As I mentioned, I do the surveying, for all managers' projects who need it, also for Becky. And she was very particular in how the plans had to be laid out, which items had to be on them, and so on. So when I did a survey and drafted the plans, we had to have several discussions and corrections about minute details none of he other managers cared about. Everybody else, when I had a question regarding their projects, I would go to their office, see if they were free, and ask the information that I needed, if I could not draw it from the documentation. Not with Becky. She demanded I make appointments with her to schedule meetings to talk about these issues. That dragged work on her projects to absurd lengths. Also, she would give me deadlines for finishing, and then take one to four weeks before even looking at what I had made. THEN she would want to discuss that, when I was already at the next project over. It was a pain. 
In December 2021, we had another falling out when she questioned me about a project that I had finished in October, and got pissed when I could not immediately recall all the details. I mumbled something like „Maybe assemble the bill not 2 months after finishing the project", and she blew up. „How dare you tell me how to to my work! I know what I am doing, and don't have to put up with a lowly assistant!" I left, and luckily, that was the last day of work in 2021. In 2022, work started with Becky calling me to her, and instructing me on how we would proceed in the future. I was not to talk to her while working unless she approached me first, or if we had a scheduled meeting. Also, I was only to talk to her about the tasks she had assigned me, nothing else, as it was not my position to tell her how to do her job. Breaks were fair game, but by then, my interest in making conversation with her had faded. So, that's how it went. 
At this point, I have to mention that as part of my job, I sometimes look at the charts of work that has already been done - how much soil has been brought in, how much of which materials have been used -, to get an idea of what needs to be included in the survey. In Becky's lists, I sometimes noticed typing mistakes, like the surveyed amount of square meters entered, when the volume (cubic meters) was demanded, which resulted in too high bills, which lead to complaints by the client and reduction of the bill. I tried to tell that to Becky, but she stopped me before I really began, pointing out again I had to focus on my job, and not speak to her unless addressed by her first. O-kay. For other managers, I would simply have corrected the mistake after quick consultation, but for her - nope. 
In the following months, I noticed a couple of these mistakes in her projects, but I kept my mouth shut. Also did not go to Jack about it, because I did not want to appear like I was blackmailing  her or something. Over the summer, I noticed more and more mistakes, and how projects that had been finished in the spring had still not been billed. But somehow Becky found the time to go on summer vacation - twice. I noticed undocumented items, false entries, lacking entries, and other mistakes in the lists of her projects, and said - nothing. In early August, she had finally assembled the bill for one of her bigger projects that had been finished months ago, and forbade anyone to talk to her while she worked on the next. 
Then I received an email. The client who had received the aforementioned bill had rejected it, due to the amount of mistakes and lack of confirmability. I had been CCed as the surveyor - but the problem was not my surveys, but that Becky had not transferred the results correctly. The client denied payment and demanded immediate correction. The sum was around 250.000€, money the company had been waiting for for months by the time. This was serious, so I decided to break my silence and tell Becky. She saw me through the glass door, and before my hand touched the handle, she yelled „Don't talk to me!" Well, then... what's a girl to do? Wait. For about 15 minutes, until my super chill boss, who'd been walking his dog over lunch break, returned to his computer. Of course he had been CCed as well, and his roar made the walls shake. Jack went to Becky's office and tore her a new one, afterwards came to me and asked me to please correct the lists as far as I am able. In the following days, he went through all of Becky's projects, and needless to say: She's gone since September. 
She wanted me to do everything her way, and I tried to comply with so much crap. In the end, I complied so much, it got her fired.</td><td>This is the answer. OP, your feelings are valid -- you will be alone at Christmas, possibly for the first time since you got married, and your feelings of loss over your wife's father are no doubt strong, on top of your feelings over her plans to be away -- it sounds like FIL's love of Christmas was quite infectious. But her feelings are also valid -- that was *her daddy*. It is sad that you can't go, and you've let her know your feelings on that -- including not liking her response, and again, that's all valid. In a way, I feel like her response as you have reported it here ("suck it up and be a man", it seemed) was unnecessarily harsh on her part.
However, OP, you need to stop bring your family drama to this other female friend *NOW*. You haven't slipped yet, but if this keeps up, it *will* happen -- *most likely while your wife is away for 8 days and you're pissed off about it because you've let this friend whisper in your ear*. *You* are not the asshole -- **yet** -- but your female friend *is*.
**And under no circumstances should you spend any time with her over Christmas while your wife is away!!** Alone or otherwise.
Talk to your *wife* about the "suck it up" part, but don't be angry or accusative when you do it. Also, don't try to force anything with her, because that will drive her away, and don't worry about it becoming a yearly thing until it actually does -- as the saying goes, "don't borrow trouble."
*But for the love of all that is good and holy, OP, do not discuss this any further with your female friend!* It is none of her business, and it was inappropriate for you to bring any of this to her in the first place. Sure, it seemed natural at the time -- you've been friends for a long time, and maybe you thought you would get a "female perspective" -- but this interaction is the thin end of the wedge that has every possibility of destroying your marriage. And it would be *you* destroying it, not your wife partying in the Caribbean, as you fear.
She isn't going alone, but you also don't have to be alone -- you have family as well. Spend the time with them, then be happy for her return and hope that the trip did what her family hopes it will.</td><td>0.787961647290534</td><td>0.2793966666336418</td><td>8</td></tr>

Hi all. I recently setup a VPN on my local network for remote access and have been playing close attention to my logs for the meantime to make sure I'm not seeing any suspicious behavior. Well.. unfortunately I *have* been seeing exactly that today, but curiously it seems entirely isolated from my VPN. I'll explain, as I'd love some thoughts..
To preface, I'm working with a relatively cheap Netgear router. No DMZ feature is enabled. UPnP is enabled, with the sole entry being my Plex server. As of yesterday, there's a single port forwarding entry, pointing towards my VPN from an obscure port.
I noticed today that I was seeing dozens of log entries in my router marked 'LAN access from remote', all forwarding a ton of different IP addresses directly toward my laptop I was actively working on, all with a different port.
My first hunch was that something I was running, Zoom or something, was connecting to external servers with UPnP, but I couldn't see any new UPnP listings in my router. Additionally, I ran \`whois\` against the IP addresses and they returned some rather suspect listings originating from all over the world. Also, I don't imagine I'd see *quite* such a spread of ports.
Ultimately, I temporarily disabled UPnP and that seemed to stop the behavior for now.
I'm very confused here and not quite sure if I should be concerned. *How* could these remote IPs been forwarded to my laptop when my port forwarding explicitly targets my VPN, a separate device. Is it significant that disabling UPnP stopped this? There's absolutely nothing configured to point towards my laptop. Could something malicious on my laptop have opened ports with UPnP? Again, I saw no UPnP entries either in my logs or registered to forward.
I suspect there might be an issue with my router that's not protecting my network as it should? For instance, I see two adjacent log entries from the same public source IP. The first registers as a DoS attack and suggested port scan, and the following entry shows the same source address being forwarded to my laptop.
If anyone has any ideas, I'm all ears, as this is a little worrying. I'm wondering if I should close my ports off for now? Although, I'm not sure that would help, given that those are pointing to a different IP anyway.
**Edit**: Looks like this is happening again, and I can confirm via Wireshark that the messages are in fact getting to my laptop.
**Update (9/1):** This just keeps getting stranger. I've since disconnected the laptop in question from my network, and I can still see my router attempting to forward traffic to it, even without any trace of that IP in the network settings. I'm currently wondering if my router is exhibiting some buggy behavior where it's assigned this laptop as the DMZ.
I re-enabled UPnP this morning and began to see the intrusions again. This time, it began recently enough that I was able to see how it started.
If you look at the logs you can see my laptop trigger 'AddPortMapping' and 'DeletePortMapping' events in quick succession, and plenty of port scanning begin almost immediately afterwards. I assume that this UPnP behavior is an exploit to persist the port mappings while erasing any trace of them from my router's interface. Scary stuff.
I've understood the concerns with UPnP until now, but holy shit.. I've obviously disabled UPnP for now and am trying to track down the source of these UPnP events in my network. I'm wondering if there's any likelihood that a device apart from my laptop is spoofing its source IP..
Has anyone seen this sort of thing before?
**Update (12/5):** For anyone who might be interested, I wrote a blog post documenting some of my findings here. TLDR: disable UPnP on your router..</td><td>Your mom is a JN, big-time. As others in the comments have said, mom isn't a "soft place to land", she's a concrete pit with metal spikes -- *stay away*. Your husband is trying to protect his new family from one who clearly wants to cause damage to it, if not outright destruction (i.e. your mother). You and hubby are a team now -- stick together no matter what she tries to do. Your husband is revealing his shiny spine and is trying to do his job to protect you from JNMom's machinations -- put on your sunglasses and hang on, cuz it's going to be a helluva ride.
> I feel like she's saying "I know you're going to get divorced one day, but don't worry, I'll be here for you when that happens."
That's *exactly* what she's saying, and even hoping for. Worst case, *she'll try to bring that prophecy to fulfillment* through her manipulations, just to maintain her control over you. She will try to pit you against hubby; *do not fall into the trap*. You say you don't want to rock the boat. It's understandable, but you *need* to flip that boat over and *throw her out of it*. Do everything you and hubby can to get out of her house and into your own place as quickly as possible. You're freaking out and mad at hubby, even though you agree in principle with what he said.  That's what *she* wants, though -- you angry at *him* instead of *her* over what *she* did wrong. *That's the trap*. Let your anger at him subside, because he did what was necessary at the moment. Your husband is not the enemy here; he's your greatest ally. I think you know that, but years of indoctrination from the *real* enemy have you reacting knee-jerk. Suppress the brainwashing and look at it rationally.
Set those boundaries, set clear penalties, and *stick to them*. If you have trouble doing it, let your husband run interference -- it seems like he's already getting into the battle here, and I think he's up to the task. Until you're strong enough to get all the way out of the FOG, let him be the bad guy (as far as mom is concerned), but don't let him do it alone; *stick with him* -- he's going to need your support. Don't let your mom tear the two of you apart.
> EDIT: I did confront her after the rent thing to let her know I thought we had agreed on just utilities, and she did back down, but it was in that moment we realized some weird dynamics were at play.
Excellent! You stood to her up in a relatively simple matter, and *you won*. Let that build some confidence in yourself. You also begin to see how things are going to start playing out, so be prepared for bigger and harder battles. Take it one battle at a time, one day at a time, and let hubby help -- that's one of the things we husbands are there for in our marriages. Don't get complacent -- get ready for the next encounter.
I'll echo what others have already said -- get some counseling to help you clear the FOG. And above all else, *talk with your husband*. He is there for you, just as much as you are there for him. He seems to have the strength you need right now to get clear -- use it, and eventually you will have your own strength and the confidence to use it.
I know that science-fiction is not everyone's cup of tea, and especially not Star Trek. But there's an episode of Deep Space Nine that I think is worth a watch (season 6, episode 7, "You Are Cordially Invited") -- Worf and Jadzia's wedding ceremony in the last few minutes of the episode. I think it shows a picture of what you and your new husband need to be in your current situation -- a united force fighting against all who would destroy you (i.e. your mother and any flying monkeys she sends your way), watching each other's backs, and picking each other up when something knocks you or hubby down. This *will* be a battle, and you need to be ready to fight it. You have already noticed the problems, and you agree with what hubby wrote. You just need the confidence in both him and the two of you together, and the strength to break through a lifetime of mom's programming.</td><td>0.7879632247275783</td><td>0.0165344070847595</td><td>8</td></tr>

Red flag laws ignore the due process of law by their very nature. With nothing more than a phone call from , you are deprived of your property and your 2nd amendment constitutional rights, which could be argued by some to be an aspect of your liberty.
Due process means that you are allowed to face your accuser in court and plead your case to defend yourself. ERPO hearings are usually held without the accused even being notified, much less allowed to present a defense or cross-examine the person accusing you.
Furthermore, it does not need to be proven you have committed a crime to deprive you of your property. The only requirement is that someone else believes you might commit a crime - harming yourself or others. This opens the door to other similar laws, where you could have your computer confiscated if someone believes you might start cyber bullying or spreading false news for example. It's impossible for the punishment to ***NOT*** be cruel and unusual when no crime has been committed in the first place.
Ignoring the gun debate entirely, red flag laws still set a dangerous precedent that people can be "convicted" and punished while never being arrested, never knowing the charges against them until it's already decided, and never setting foot in a court of law to defend themselves.

To make policy based on the *statistical* trait of their sex was sexist. Women fought long and hard for the right to be judged based on *individual merit*, and sure enough many women can, and do, perform work that takes great strength. There are strong women and weak men. Yes, *statistically* men are bigger and stronger, and hence you will *statistically* find more men capable of being firefighters than women, but that is irrelevant to the equality of a test of *individual merit*.
That's the inherent sexism of Ellen Pao's policy, and similar ones. They treat people based on the statistical traits of their sexes, not on their individual merits. It's a reversal of the movement of equality.
With respect to race, Martin Luther King's dream was "I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character." Likewise, gender equality looks to the day when people will not be judged by their biological sex, or their sexual orientation, but by the content of their character and the merit of their skills.
Pao spits on MLK's dream. She changes the rules specifically because of the statistical traits of people's biological sex and not to their individual character or skills.
Shame on her, and on anybody who proposes such sexist madness.</td><td>> screaming about AI destroying artists' livelihoods.

This makes them unreasonably upset. 'They want it 'just cancelling'. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.

Hi
We started receiving alerts for a few OCSP certificates expiring on our ISE infrastructure (specifically on a few PSNs), which we have "inherited", so there are things we didn't configured ourselves.
In particular, what we got is that there already seem to be newer OCSP certificates there, which will expire in a few years. The difference between those and the expiring ones is that there's no *AuthAdmin* role selected for the formers.
As I could understand OCSP certificates are alternatives to CRL, so, by my very limited experience with certificate management I didn't consider them to be *crucial* for the ISE management.
I was assuming that enabling the *AuthAdmin* role on the newer certificate would have done the trick... but it seems more complex than that.
what I did was
* disabling the authadmin role on the expiring one
* enabling it on the newer one
* backing up the older certificate - *just in case*
* trying removing it
an alert popped up saying that it could be basically catastrophic to do something wrong with them
Can anyone help me understand what could be the consequences of removing an OCSP expiring certificates with newer ones already present, and if we could do that without worrying too much?
thanks</td><td>Both.  I just got a 2019 1500 limited elevation (so, a 2018 made in 2019) with the 5.3l and 6l80 trans.  I paid 33k, 67k miles.
I am a preventative maintenance nut too, and with these trucks you need to watch for trans and lifter problems (researched) - the best things you can do (to my understanding) without tearing them apart and replacing major components, is to use the OBD2 range chip for full time V8 and to get the GM bulletin trans thermostat installed, which has your trans start cooling at 158F rather than 180F.  GM has acknowledged that 180-190F is a little hot and eventually you will have a torque converter failure.  So this isn't some non-factory mod.
ALSO, I get my thermostat installed 7/17, so my trans is still running hot.  180-190F just driving - towed heavy once for a short distance and it got up to 205, so I won't be towing heavy until I get the new thermostat.</td><td>0.7640325892953468</td><td>0.0462149437607265</td><td>8</td></tr>

Background: My fiancé and I lived with my parents when we had our baby. We lived with them for the first five months of baby's life before getting our own place. The only reason for this was because our baby was a surprise and we had to wait until fiancé's lease ended at his place before getting a place of our own together. My MIL was very jealous of my parents getting to see baby every day. She tried to get fiancé to live with her again and it was all very dramatic. She even tried to take my fiancé's military housing benefit to buy herself a house that we can live in with her. That was super dramatic too. Anyways, she thought she wasn't seeing our baby as often as she wanted to because of our living situation with my parents. When we moved out and the frequency of her visits remained the same, she continued to be unhappy and decided to move across the country to where her other son has just moved to because he and his wife are due to have a baby this year and she wants to be overbearing with at least one of her grandchildren. Sorry SIL, it ain't gonna be my baby, haha.
Ever since BIL moved to their new location, the talk has started about us moving there too. We've always wanted to go there but at this point in time it's not in the plan. Our baby isn't a year old yet. I've still got a few classes left before finishing my bachelors. My fiancé still has a class before finishing his associates. He has an amazing job that has already given him a raise and he's been working there for a little over a year. There is a lot of potential growth. My parents and great grandmother are here and my baby LOVES them (we obviously love them too). And our friends are here. We've started our life here and BIL and MIL are blatantly disregarding that. They won't stop pressuring us to move across the country. 
MIL went house hunting there this week. She is single. She has kept saying "when you move you can live with me" and we either shrug her off or directly say we don't want to do that. And yet, she is interested in buying a home with a 2 bedroom basement apartment so that we can live with her.
The reason this bothers me, other than disregarding our life where we live now and our direct "NO," is the money. She is a very greedy person and when it comes to money, she'll find a way to get some out of a situation if she can. So knowing her, I'm afraid she's going to buy this big house for herself, and when we don't move there with her we'll never hear the end of it. "I got this big house for you guys and you aren't even coming" or worse, she'll pull the "I am your mother and I raised you by myself and I'm still trying to help you the least you could do is help pay for this house I got for us." (That was actually a very accurate statement that could come out of her mouth, if you all knew her you would be impressed with me lol). 
Obviously we won't owe her a dime. It's just annoying that in addition to being nagged to move, we will more than likely be nagged for money too. Just today my fiancé tried to open another savings account and was denied by his bank due to a poor financial report at another institution. He has no idea what it could be. He has amazing credit and no student loans. My spidey senses are going off and saying she did something in my fiancé's name. Wouldn't be the first time. If that is the case I'm hoping that will be an example for her as to why we aren't close to her. If it were up to me, I would do a lot to cut her off financially but my fiancé is very much in the fog. He took her off his main bank account but he won't take the identity protection steps he needs to take in order to protect himself since she has his social security number and can easily do shady things.
So yeah, here's to hoping she moves away and realizes that she doesn't need all that space when it will be her living there, ALONE, she'll save herself some money, and hopefully we won't hear about it.</td><td>That sounds like a variation of Management Stack Theory, courtesy of BOFH. The idea is that many people only have so much space in their mental process stacks, and that anything that pushes over that limit causes a stack reset, which results in an undefined mental stack state. It could be cleared out, or it could be a complete pig's breakfast of whatever was in the stack at the time of the reset, including the item that caused the reset. Simon Travaglia has a much better description of the phenomenon, plus a great working example.
You have to give those people little bits of the process at a time, because larger, more abstract statements use up much more stack and lead to sooner resets.</td><td>0.7640326403651162</td><td>0.1276839856005849</td><td>8</td></tr>

We were presented with partnerships as a method of bringing new players into the game. This is simply not the case.
In the July 1st post announcing the upcoming partnership polls, Jagex stated:
>"We think it's worth taking a moment to explain how games in our positions can go about attracting new players,"
and
>"Looking after you all is every bit as important as trying to attract new people into the Old School family."
First of all, anyone with any business sense should know that is it far far more important to retain customers than bring in new ones, especially when using a subscription based model. Losing a loyal customer means losing a steady stream of money. Bringing in a new customer brings risk: they could either stay and play the game, or they could decide it's not for them. And let's face it, as much as we all love it, Old School Runescape isn't the most appealing game.
* It has poor graphics, by modern standards
* It has awkward controls (tick delay, tick manipulation; really the whole tick system)
* It is overrun with bots, especially in the early game
* It is extremely slow, and often isn't fun to train skills
* There is lots of necessary information which isn't provided in the game, and has to be found externally
I'm not saying any one of these points is a bad thing, but it means that Old School Runescape is appealing to a very specific type of gamer, and we are far from the majority. I've attempted to introduce several friends into the game, and not one of them decided to stick around and play after the first day.
Runescape is an incredibly unique and special game. How many players do you know who spend over eight hours a day playing? How many players do you know who have been playing for over a decade? I'm positive Jagex knows how incredibly loyal and and passionate their fan base is – **it is impossible to be ignorant of this.** If partnerships went through – let's assume ten thousand people left the game, and ten thousand new players were introduced. How many of those new player do you think will stick around? Even if we're generous and say half of them continue to play, that's still five thousand subscribers lost.
So no, looking after the current player base and attracting new people are in no way equally important.
Secondly – the partnership rewards we were presented with were never going to bring new players into the game.
Suppose you had no knowledge of Runescape, and you happen across this partnership opportunity:
>"Sign up now and you'll be able to decorate your in game house with a Dorgesh-Kaan theme!"
What is Dorgesh-Kaan? What is Mount Karuulm? What is Prifddinas? Will a new player know who Zaros is? No, so why would having their home teleport reskinned to represent him be appealing?
*"Hey, look at this. If I play this game, I can make my skin orange and use the Dramatic Point emote. I'm going to sign up right now"* said no one ever.
These are all incredibly unappealing to new potential players, because **contrary to what Jagex told us, they were never meant for new players.** The partnership "rewards" were meant for three groups:
1&2: Current and former players. Settled has nearly a quarter million subscribers on YouTube; mostly people who play the game, with a smaller chunk of the audience made up by people who no longer play the game but still enjoy it in some capacity. It is no coincidence the first reward in the poll was the Morytania decorations. Current players who are Swampletics fans will engage with the partners to get the theme, and some former players will likely feel nostalgic and decide to come back, either for a short period of time or a long period of time.
Some people like fashionscaping. Certainly someone out there was excited at the prospect of grey skin. Frankly, the yellow skin would probably look great with my current outfit. But I do not believe that anyone decides to start playing OSRS for the first time for the purposes of fashionscape.
3: The partners. If "Company X" is going to partner up with Jagex, they need to make the offer enticing – they need something to get their foot in the door with potential customers. Exclusivity is great for partners because that means they have a (temporary) monopoly on certain aspects of the game, and players are forced to come to them.
**Make no mistake: these rewards were never intended for bringing new players into the game, and presenting it as such is simply dishonest.** They are solely meant to extract more money from current players.
But at the end of the day, even if Jagex had been honest about their reasoning behind it, if they had been upfront and said it was meant for the current player base, would that even have worked? Are players going to give money to another company for skin colours and emotes – especially when they'll be able to access them for free when the period of exclusivity has expired?
As far as cosmetics go, the polled rewards were lame – and they would have to be. Old School Runescape has some very cool cosmetics: Champions Cape, Fish Sack, Castle Wars armour. A bought and paid for cosmetic will never be as cool as a hard earned one – devaluing current cosmetics was never a risk. These rewards were intentionally designed to be low value to players.
But when the partnership rewards are low value to players, they are low value to partners as well. When a reskin of a home teleport inevitably fails to excite players, Jagex will be forced to add value to the rewards. ~~We all know that Runescape 3's micro-transations started off with promises that Jagex would stick to cosmetics. That didn't pan out, and there's no reason to think this would.~~
TL;DR – Jagex lied about their intentions. The rewards were never meant to bring in new players, they were meant to warm us up to future MTX.
PS: I would love to believe that I am wrong about this, but I can not. To believe Jagex would value new players the same as current players, and their method of attracting them was through low value rewards - half of which wouldn't even make sense to new players, would reqyure a frankly staggering amount of incompetence. I do not believe the Old School team is incompetent. To believe they introduced what is essentially a road map to mtx, completely by accident, is to do a disservice to both their intelligence and your own, especially considering we sad the exact same thing happen in Runescape 3.</td><td>I am not a trump supporter, but Trump has deported significantly less hispanics than obama in a 4 year comparative time span.

Is Federal research money widely enough needed at American Colleges and Universities to make nationwide change? What specifically have Colleges and Universities done to stifle Free Speech? On Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), President Trump announced an Executive Order that would require Universities and Colleges to support free speech under the penalty of having their federal research money cut:
> "Today I am proud to announce that I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech if they want federal research dollars," the president said...
> "If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they've got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people and old people, to speak, free speech," said Trump. "If they don't, it will be very costly. That will be signed very soon."
The Washington Post sought comment from Cynthia Miller-Idriss, an associate professor of education at American University. She believes the President is on firm ground:
> "There's a history of the federal government requiring universities to do certain kinds of things in order to receive federal research funding," she said in an interview. For example, she said, the U.S. government imposes ethical guidelines on studies involving human subjects.
I have a couple of questions:
1: How many Colleges and Universities seek Federal research money? Specifically, what percentage of Universities and Colleges seek Federal research money?
2: The written order has not yet been released, so there's some ambiguity to what "support free speech" means, but the President left little ambiguity that he believes there is a free speech problem on America's campuses. 
What specifically have Colleges and Universities done to limit free speech? Is this a new occurrence? Have they stated why they are doing it?</td><td>Conventional wisdom here seems to be that Trump and McConnell will fast-track a replacement. They might have if she had died 6 months ago, but this close to the election I predict they won't, for a few reasons.
1. It's a dangerous game to play with moderates. I think trying to condense this process down to 6 weeks or even a bit longer (to try to do it in a potential lame duck situation) will turn off voters.
2. I'm not sure they can get the votes. Romney, Collins, and maybe a few others would oppose this.
3. Perhaps most importantly, an open Supreme Court seat is gold for the Republicans and I don't know why they would waste it. "We can't push a justice through this term. If you don't come out and vote for Trump and Republicans in the Senate, Biden will nominate an abortion loving activist liberal to the court".
What you might see is Trump and Biden both pressured to name their potential nominees. I wouldn't be surprised if Trump vets a candidate and even releases the name publicly before the election (Barrett seems like a logical choice) as more red meat for the base.</td><td>0.7640392026201335</td><td>0.1666183004348924</td><td>8</td></tr>

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>NESTLE Swiss food giant Nestle will set up a   global research and development center for snack foods next year in   Sderot, a town in Israel's Negev desert, the Maariv newspaper reported   on Sunday.</td><td>European taxes are less progressive than American taxes but the Democrats want to tax the rich even more (in fact, as measured by how much tax the rich pay, the US has the most progressive tax system in the OECD).</td><td>Everything every BDS-hole should boycott but never will So your  organization has decided to boycott all products and services from  Israel. Here is a list of activities that you now need to perform in  order to comply with this boycott.
First,  remove all Intel Pentium and Celeron computer processor chips from  personal computers (desktops, laptops and notebooks) as these were  either developed or manufactured in Israel.
Note that the  revolutionary new Ivy Bridge processor will be manufactured in  Israel. Any computers running the Windows XT operating system must be  turned off immediately as this was developed in Israel. All current  Microsoft operating systems are not to be used as Microsoft is heavily  reliant on its Israel R&D centre.
**Step 2**.  Any computers that still work need to have their anti-virus software  and personal firewalls removed as this technology originated in Israel.  The organisation's firewall will also need to be switched off. Staff  should no longer open external emails as most of these will be infected  with viruses. No outgoing emails can be sent. The algorithm (code)  that's used today for sending e-mails, was made by an Israeli who worked  at the Ben-Gurion University in Be'er-Sheva in 1980.
**Step 3**.  Discard all mobile phones, as this technology was developed in Israel,  where the first mobile phones were manufactured. Mobile chip technology  from a single Israeli company has now been installed in over 100 million  devices. Only top-level staff may retain mobile phones for emergency  situations. However the use of SMS (Texting) is expressly forbidden as  this facility was developed in Israel. No 4G devices can be used, as the  chipset is Israeli.
**Step 4**. Turn off  your voice-mail service and delete any recorded messages. Israeli  companies invented the voice-mail system. If someone you do not know  answers your phone-call, then hang up. Israeli call-centres and  call-centre technology is in widespread operation in the UK.
**Step 5**.  Before accepting any printed material, check that the supplier has not  used the Israeli device that might have saved up to 50% of the ink used.
**Step 6**.  At home, do not use Facebook as many in-built and add-on applications  are Israeli-developed. Do not watch videos on the Internet as the  platform used to upload them may be from AOL and hence from an Israeli  company. Do not use the Internet to search for answers to your questions  as this may involve use of an Israeli-developed search engine. Better  to remain unenlightened.
**Step 7**. On your  TV or home entertainment centre, do not use Video On Demand (VOD) to  watch movies as you may inadvertently see an advert displayed  using Israeli software. Do not purchase any games devices as these are  likely to use Israeli technology.
**Step 8**.  Do not read books using an e-book as this may contain Israeli  technology. Do not use data storage as it may have been developed at  Israel's storage technology R&D center.
**Step 9**.  Do not buy an electric car as it is likely to be powered with  an Israeli battery or use Israeli developed charging mats. Continue to  sit in traffic knowing that you are polluting the environment and  financing oil-rich despotic regimes.
Turning to  food and drink, all food outlets on the organisation's premises must  dispose of cherry tomatoes, which were developed in Israel. Staff must  ensure that no cherry tomatoes are included in sandwiches brought into  office premises. The ban also applies to honey and any products derived  from honey. Israel has developed solutions to the worldwide problem of  bee-colony collapse, so that any products derived from bees might only  be available now due to an Israeli invention.
Avoid  drinking any of the world-recognized award-winning Israeli wines. Do not  consume homemade drinks from Israeli-manufactured household drinks  machines.
Avoid any fruit from South Africa or Peru as produce from these countries is being marketed with Israeli brand names.
No  agricultural products from the following areas must be consumed as they  use water irrigation and agricultural technology provided directly from  Israel. This includes most of Africa, China, India, Indonesia (a Muslim  country), Nepal and many others.
Much fruit and  vegetables (including organic) imported into the UK has been enhanced  using Israeli technology. This may save millions of people from starving  around the world, but is not a good reason for you to eat it. To be  safe, only eat fruit and vegetables that you have grown yourself using  seeds that have been in your family for generations.
Destroy  all personal medication. Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals, the largest  generic drugs company in the world, will have manufactured many of your  medicines.  Staff with the following illnesses will need to take  specific precautions.
Cancer – do not take any form of  medication or treatment. Israeli scientists have been working at the  forefront of oncology for decades.
AIDS and HIV – beware;  researchers at Israel's Weizmann Institute or Hebrew University  developed or improved AZT and Hypericin-based drugs; they have also  developed a treatment that destroys HIV-infected cells without damaging  healthy ones.
Diabetes – do not measure or inject Insulin using the devices developed by Israeli scientists.
Multiple  Sclerosis – stop taking Copaxone, one of the most efficient medicines  and the only non-interferon agent, as Teva developed it.  Don't  touch Laquinimod either.
Parkinson's – remove the  Israel-pioneered brain pacemaker to stop tremors. Discontinue Levodopa,  which reduces motor disturbances. Cease sessions that involve magnetic  cortex stimulation.
Staff with a family history of heart  disease and arteriosclerosis must not use the Israeli device for early  detection of these.  Rather, wait until onset of the disease.
Epileptics  – stop treatment that may have benefited from the Israeli discovery of  the underlying mutant gene; also throw away the bracelet that sends out  an alert when a person goes into seizure.
Staff or relatives with Age-related Macular Degeneration – remove Israeli implants that arrest the disease.
Liver disease – abandon Israeli-developed antibody immunotherapy treatments.
Emphysema – steer clear of the Israeli protein replacement therapy.
Myeloma – stop taking the drug Velcade, which was developed over a period of 30 years by scientists at Haifa.
Sleep apnea – no tests using the breakthrough Israeli device for diagnosis.
Dyslexics must not benefit from the Israeli Internet-based reading system.
Skin allergies must be treated with steroid creams only, as the new safer non-steroid alternative is Israeli.
Any  incident of stroke or head trauma or onset of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,  MS, epilepsy, glaucoma or brain tumor must avoid using any of the  Weizmann Institute's patented methods of treatment.
Before  any surgery or medical tests, check that hospital catheters have not  been protected from infection using the new plastic from Israel that  disables microorganisms. Avoid throat surgery as this may utilize  Israeli surgical lasers.
Ensure any colonoscopy or gastro  investigation does not use internal Israeli cameras such as the  Pillcam.  Never undergo surgery to install an artificial heart, as the  first artificial heart transplant took place in Israel.
Kidney  transplant patients must wait for donors of the same blood group as  only Israel's revolutionary new methods allow donors from other blood  groups.  Staff of Arab origin must not make use of the only database for  matching potential Arab donors of bone-marrow – in Israel.
In  the event of a spinal injury or disease, do not accept spinal  implants – likely to be an Israeli product or development. Heart rhythm  problems must not be solved with the Israeli-developed heart pulse  generator. All heart stents are off-limits as most of these originate  from Israeli medical companies.
Check all vaccines as many  of these have been developed in Israel.  Ensure that all X-rays do  carry a radiation risk, as the only radiation-free system is  Israeli.  Treatments derived from Stem Cell research must be avoided  as most of these are Israeli-developed.
If you or your  family are struck with a bacterial infection, do not take alternatives  to older, ineffective bacteria-resistant antibiotics, as an  Israeli discovery will have been responsible for the modern, effective  drugs. Check that any pain relief medication is not based on soya as an  Israeli doctor discovered the beneficial effect of the soya bean.
Do  not use the revolutionary new Israeli bandage that saved the life of  Arizona senator Gabriella Giffords after she was shot in the head.  If  you break a bone badly, reject any treatment that involves introducing  collagen, as this may have been manufactured from Israeli plants.
Do not protect babies and infants from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome with the Babysense system from Israel.
Do not use Epilady (or epilator) – two Israelis invented this hair removal device.
Finally, reject all major dental treatment, as your teeth may need to be scanned with an Israeli-developed dental scanner.
When  interviewing prospective new staff or holding meetings with members of  the public or with individuals from other companies, it is vital that  you check whether they originate from, or are associated with the  following countries and areas. You must ensure that you do not have any  contact with people who have benefited from Israel's aid to those  countries. The organization must avoid any possible acknowledgment of  Israel's contribution to world relief.   In addition, you must obtain a  formal statement from the government of these countries that Israeli aid  was not responsible for the production or development of any goods and  services supplied to the organization.

Central America (Israel sent emergency medical aid teams and equipment to help victims of Hurricane Mitch in 1998)
Pakistan (2005) and Peru (2007) both accepted aid from Israeli NGOs following earthquake disasters.
Peru's hydro-electric power plants are also being built and run by an Israeli company.
Rawanda, Mexico, Chad,  Sudan (Darfur) and Malawi all have received humanitarian aid from  Israel, including medical assistance from Israel's NGO IsraAID.
Always  remember that the boycott extends to any individuals from the above  regions that have been exposed to Israeli assistance during the 63 years  existence of the current Jewish State.
\-Reject  all products from the USA. Analysis conducted in a typical US  stateshows that Israeli innovations were responsible for $2.4 billion in  direct revenue to that state's economy in 2009 and generated nearly  6,000 jobs.
\-Do not tutor your children in advanced  Mathematics techniques, which may have originated in Israel. Also, if  these techniques are used in your children's schools, withdraw your  children immediately.
\-Keen ornithologists should consider  giving up their hobby as many rarespecies stop off or reside in Israel  during their twice-yearly migration.
\-Do not watch the new series of NCIS as one of the actresses is Israeli.
\-Avoid going to any football matches featuring teams with Israeli players.
\-Destroy  all your recordings of Madonna, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Deep  Purple, Bon Jovie, Justin Bieber, George Benson, Moby and many, many  more artists who have ridiculed the illogical boycott and have proudly  performed (or will shortly perform) concerts in Israel.
\-Destroy  any recordings of U2, Lady Gaga, Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, Beck,  Rihanna Coldplay and any artist whose music has been recorded using  the sound technology of the Grammy Award winning Israeli company Wave  Audio. You also must get rid of any personal copies of *Shrek*,*American Beauty* and *Star Wars*. Do not trust anything recorded by Sony, JVC, Toshiba or Dell.
\-Don't go to see *The Black Swan* with Natalie Portman, or watch any old films with Elizabeth Taylor – both lovers of the Jewish State.
\-Do not stay in hotels or visit shopping centers owned by Israeli companies (sorry, you will need to check which ones yourself).
\-Do not have anything to do with the banks who are using Israeli software to prevent fraud.
\-Do  not use any credit or debit card as the Security monitoring system used  by the credit card companies is likely to be Israeli.
\-Do not buy an engagement ring containing a diamond as it is possible that this may have been cut in Israel.
\-Do not travel by air, as your plane might get towed by the Israeli-built "Taxibot."
\-Do not use public transport inside Amsterdam, Moscow or Northern Chinain case you benefit from Israeli transportation devices.
\-If  you suffer a power or network failure, be grateful that at least you  haven't installed the Israeli system that prevents power outages.
\-Finally,  you need to leave all your taps running when you leave home and must  never flush your  toilet, because Israel provides water-saving technology to over half of  the planet. It also is providing sewage treatment technology across the  world, including to the UK. It should be obvious by now that all the  measures specified in Parts 1 – 4 of this series of blogs will  inevitably mean that your organization and your staff will be completely  unable to function.  Let's therefore hope that the decision by your  organization to boycott Israeli products is flushed down the toilet of  history.

From  1966 onward Coca-Cola has been a  staunch supporter of Israel. Recently  the Government of Israel Economic  Mission honored Coca-Cola at the  Israel Trade Award Dinner for its  continued support of Israel for the  last 30 years and for refusing to  abide by the Arab League boycott of  Israel.
NESTLE
Swiss food giant Nestle will set up a   global research and development center for snack foods next year in   Sderot, a town in Israel's Negev desert, the Maariv newspaper reported   on Sunday. Nestle owns 50.1 percent of Israeli food maker Osem   Investments and the two together produce snack foods at a plant in   Sderot.
DISNEY
The Disney Company is owned by Jewish  Mogul  Michael Eisner. He owns a vast media empire that includes the  ABC  television network, numerous news dailies, national magazines,  Hollywood  film companies and a large number of radio stations. One  radio station  in Los Angeles, KABC 790 AM recently broadcast comments  by Jewess Gloria  Alred to the effect that the Islamic prisoners at  Guantanamo should be  tortured by having their "balls" extracted with  pliers in order to make  them talk. The news and commentaries made  through Michael Eisner's media  octopus are extremely Islamophobic and  anti-Palestinian.
KIMBERLY-CLARK
In 1998 Mr. Robert  P. Van der Merwe,  chairman of Kimberly-Clark Europe received the  Jubilee Award by the  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. This is the  highest tribute ever  awarded by the "State of Israel" in recognition of  those individuals and  organizations, that through their investments  and trade relationships,  have done the most to strengthen the Israeli  economy.

**I think, you need the whole world to boycott All these Israeli Products. If you can! Haha.**</td><td>The idea that "Democrats are conservatives in Europe" is a Reddit meme that is at best half true. Some aspects of the role of government are just different in Europe, and that's fine. In particular, both the employer-employee relationship (limits on hours, rules about wages, required time off, etc.) and healthcare systems are just different as a norm. It's not so much that the conservatives in Europe don't support privatizing health insurance, as much as it is that this just isn't a political position that is discussed. Some of this is just cultural. For example, a policy to only allow government communications, schools, and businesses in the dominant language would be called "racist" by the American left, but is accepted in France. 
However, there are many mainstream positions in Europe that are far closer to the American right in other issues. You already mentioned immigration. European taxes are less progressive than American taxes but the Democrats want to tax the rich even more (in fact, as measured by how much tax the rich pay, the US has the most progressive tax system in the OECD). Countries like Sweden have privatized pensions and what we would call school choice, where parents can direct government money to private schools instead of public ones. 
Many Democrats in the US support positions that are left of Europe, such as wealth taxes, apportioning government benefits based on race, outlawing gas cars, or disfavoring merit-based immigration.
In reality, the cultures are just different. Europeans prefer a larger government in general, which is fine. But it's not as simple as saying that Republicans are off the chart to the right in Europe on all issues.</td><td>0.764040660008835</td><td>-0.0419295614140386</td><td>8</td></tr>

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>I'm mostly changing names, titles and commenting out things Amalgamated doesn't handle, like credit cards or healthcare data.</td><td>Made some changes on a switch to enable a new IP camera system we were installing, but got some things jacked up, so he rebooted the switch.</td><td>Call before you dig... I'm working for a strange consulting firm that still isn't sure what to do with me, but the pay's good.  
  
   
  
After the [previous] gig, I'm told to get myself to a suburban office park somewhere in Missouri and join an existing engagement with Amalgamated Pipelines (AP).  
  
  
  
It's late Spring, so business travel becomes an excuse to ride my motorcycle. A day and a half later, I'm at my second home- a mid-grade hotel chain with the amenities I want- room service, a small hotel bar with a familiar point of sale system.  
  
  
I check in, clean up and park myself at the bar, which is sparsely occupied. I drop my laptop at the bar and start reading through the documents from the client as well as previous emails.  
   
  
Looks like Amalgamated has decided to assess and fix their cybersecurity in a few weeks, like cleaning up from a week long house-party fifteen minutes before Mom & Dad come home.  
  
  
I've been tasked with writing an entire policy kit this week. There's an external team doing some kind of vulnerabilty scan, but I'm not involved. My firm is also doing some consulting around restructuring financial stuff, but I skip over those threads.  
  
  
I find the docs I am interested in- network and infrastructure. Their regular IT network looks like late 90's state of the art- MPLS WANs between offices. The Industrial Control Systems (ICS) networks are much less detailed- the top level diagram of the whole network looks like marketing material- it's not a hastily pushed together Visio doc, but without specifics. There's some spreadsheet as an inventory- devices and locations and 172.16.x.x addresses.  
   
  
Ok. I do notice that they've handed over _nothing_ for the usual policies & procedures. I'll just buy one of those off the shelf policy kits and get AP to let me know what they don't, can't or won't do.  
   
  
It's imperfect, but that's what you get when you only have a week.  
   
  
A few more people find their way to the hotel bar, and we're all living the same life. Laptops and drinks. I notice one laptop across the bar from me with a variety of hacker conference stickers. The owner is a 30 something woman picking at a plate of fries and pipetting drops of water into a glass of scotch while staring at her screen.  
  
  
I go back to my room and slap together some slides describing my part of this project for tomorrow's kickoff and go to bed.  
  
  
The next morning, I boil water with the in-room coffee maker to make oatmeal, and make it to Amalgamated's offices.  
  
  
I get to meet the teams. My firm has a handful of management consultants, but I'm the only IT or security consultant. There's another firm doing a pentest. After the initial kickoff meeting, I'll get to try to coordinate with the handful of people I need to talk to. I'd expect to overlap with the pentest team to save time.  
  
  
Right as the meeting starts, I see the Scotch-drinking woman from the bar and her bestickered laptop. There are intros and a lot of backstory about Amalgamated. I really don't care, but I want to look attentive and easy to work with.  
  
  
After the meeting, I meet Ralph, Amalgamated's Director of IT. He wants to make sure I  get settled in. I follow him through a maze of mouse-colored cubicles. I think I'm in a sales or customer service phone bank as the people around me are busy taking short phone calls. Ralph has a neutral American accent, which makes me guess he's either from Central Ohio or he's suppressing a thicker accent.  
   
  
This distracts me. I want to force him to say "to be" or "needs done" and solve this mystery. After some chit-chat in his office, we agree on the plan- I'm going to give him parts of the generic policy and he'll assign Amalgamated staff to make comments. Once we collect all their inputs, I'll edit the policies and they can sign off on them. The next week will be spent poking people, fighting over wording and writing.  
   
  
Policy writing ain't easy but it's necessary. I'll be chasing stakeholders like Tom chased Jerry.  
  
  
The first day, it's sending emails and editing the policy template. I'm mostly changing names, titles and commenting out things Amalgamated doesn't handle, like credit cards or healthcare data. This isn't complicated work, so I get to take in my surroundings. Most of the people at Amalgamated have worked here for years. Their cubes are decorated with plaques showing how long they've been there. During coffee breaks, I wander around to see many five and ten year plaques of different colors. I'll have to ask Ralph when I talk to him next.  
  
  
Most of the office empties out at 4:55, but one woman in a cube near me sticks around.  
  
  
I try listening into her calls. Maybe she's renting real estate on the side. Her calls start out with narrowing down a particular property and then telling them either "you're OK" or "we'll be out there within 48 hours. Don't do any work in the area until we're there".  
  
  
Fine. I've done my day's work, so I leave Amalgamated. The parking lot's empty, so I deliberately ride over the speed bumps fast enough to catch air.  
  
  
Simple pleasures, like a dinner at Waffle House and a book. I ride back to the hotel and park myself in the bar to have a drink and catch up on other work.  
   
  
After a beer or two and some timesheets, I notice Scotch & Water at the bar. I wave to her and manage a brief conversation:  
  
  
me:"Hey- I saw you at the kickoff- looking at your stickers, you're on the pentest?"  
  
  
  
  
me:"Great. I'm writing policies this week. Did you get any details on their ICS systems? All I saw was marketing material"  
  
  
  
  
me:"I'd like to believe that, but I'd like to believe a lot of things that aren't true"  
  
  
  
  
I leave her be, finish my drink and go up to my room.  
  
  
Oddly enough, I've already received some comments on my drafts. Most of them are the usual- changes for people's titles, nitpicky comments on wording.  
  
  
And an odd one. In the Network Security Policy, there was a section that read like it was from the early 90's:  
  
  
  
  
"Any system with a dial-up connection shall use an unique password before being connected to the telephone network"  
  
  
I figured this wasn't relevant, so I commented with a terse:"I'm pretty sure you're not using dialup any more, so I'd suggest removing this or limiting it to fax/multifunction printers"  
  
  
This seems to be a controversial topic. This has sparked an entire back and forth between a few Amalgamated staff which comes to a conclusion that the Industrial Control Systems team can't meet this for all their dial-up systems and that it's overly burdensome to fix.  
  
  
This keeps me up at night. What sort of stuff do they have on dialup?  
  
  
The next morning, I get my coffee and park myself in my cubicle. Before the calls start, I poke my head over the cubicle wall and introduce myself to my office neighbor.  
   
  
me:"Hi there. I'm just a contractor working with you all. What are you all doing?"  
  
  
My neighbor looks at me and cocks her head to the side, like I asked a _really_ dumb question.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Neighbor:"We've got maps of all our buried assets. When someone wants to dig, they call us and we let them know if we need to mark the property."  
  
  
She points at a map of what looks like the western halves of Missouri.  
  
Neighbor:"I'm responsible for the MOARLA corridor. Candy, next cube over is responsible for Texas and New Mexico"  
  
  
I look at the map on her cubicle and see lines crossing Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana. There are details as well. I see components of the pipelines and other details in small print.  
  
  
I hear a voice booming behind me. It comes from a large, bearded man who consciously flexes his muscles. I know he has an axe. I just hope it isn't in his office. I'll call him Tormund.  
   
  
  
  
  
  
Tormund:"I need you to be more reasonable with your policies"  
  
  
  
  
Tormund:"Unique passwords are too hard to manage. Our systems aren't connected to the Internet, so it doesn't matter. I also want the airgap testing requirement out of the policy"  
  
  
  
  
Tormund:"Yes. I'm a manager in the Industrial Controls department."  
  
  
  
  
   
  
I'm imagining what's going on in his head. It's not pretty.  
  
  
I put my hands up.  
  
  
me:"You say your systems are airgapped, but won't test to make sure"  
  
  
Tormund's nostrils flare.  
  
 
Tormund:"If you can't read the diagram we sent you, we should replace you with someone who can"  
   
  
me:"Look, I'll figure out who can sign off on this. I'll let you know"  
  
  
Tormund grunts and walks off. This is going to be fun.  
   
  
Thankfully the rest of the day is filled with less threatening meetings, comments on documents and listening into the "Call before you dig" calls.  
  
  
One caller seems to be a bit demanding. This reminds me of my help desk days. I can't hear the caller, but I can hear Candy's voice.  
  
  
Candy:"Sir, I understand that it's your land. We bought the rights to have a pipeline there"  
  
  
  
  
  
Candy:"Let me assure you, if you dig through our 12 inch pipeline, damage to your auger is the least of your worries."  
  
  
We all have a laugh at this. Candy seems to have calmed down her angry Texan.  
  
  
Everybody filters out by 5, but I'm still waiting on some edits before I leave. I take the opportunity to walk through the cube maze.  
  
  
I stop at Candy's cube and look at her map to get an idea how these pipelines work. Pipelines are layered networks. At the bottom of their OSI model, there are long tubes filled with petroleum products. On top of them are thin electrical networks to power pumps, sensors and valves and their controllers. On top of that, there's a conventional network controlling all this.  
  
  
That network runs back to control buildings.  
   
  
All this makes sense to me. There are faint notes on the map as well. I note many of the controllers have four or ten digit numbers faintly written next to them.  
  
  
I look around, then take a few pictures with my phone.  
  
  
My phone buzzes. It's a demanding email from the Director of Industrial Controls, who I assume is Tormund's boss. Since their systems are airgapped, they feel that it's absolutely ridiculous that they should have to meet unreasonable standards, let alone let those standards be written down in a policy document. More than a few people at my firm are cc'd.  
  
  
I've had enough for the day. I go back to the hotel, change and try to find decent barbecue. Sadly, all I can find is a Bandana's, which will have to suffice.  
  
  
As I see it, I'm either going to have to go to my boss and get some cover or capitulate to the ICS Wildlings.  
  
  
I plead with the waitress to bring me a plain seltzer, even trying to explain that the little switch on the side of the dispenser can be used to make this.  
  
  
She brings me a Sprite and I am sad.  
   
  
I'm mashing at my phone, getting sweet barbecue sauce on the screen when the picture of the map from Candy's cubicle comes up. Out of idleness, I swipe around the map of Texas.  
  
  
I don't know why I write down the number written on the map. I really don't know why I decide to call it.  
  
  
It answers after three rings.  
   
  
EoooooEEEEEEEoooooHHHHHHH ping ping ping ping.  
  
  
I'm a kid of the 90's. I know what a modem attempting a handshake sounds like.  
   
  
I use a few napkins and the cup of Sprite to wash my hands, I drop more than sufficient money on the table and run out of the restaurant. I pull on my helmet, jacket and gloves and make good time back to the hotel. I run to my room before taking off my helmet.  
   
  
Fifteen minutes and twenty dollars later in the hotel's business center, I have printed off Candy's map. I sit at the bar, drinking cold seltzer and calling up modems, marking the results on the printout. A few turn out to be actual humans in a port facility or control room. Some guessing later and I figure out the area codes and exchanges for most of the other numbers on the map.  
  
  
I'm practically spinning on my barstool. I see Scotch & Water walk into the bar. I walk over to her disappointment.  
  
  
me:"How would you like some high findings on your pentest report?"  
  
  
Her annoyance turns into amusement as I walk her through what I found out, including dialing one of the modems.  
    
   
She opens her laptop and starts chatting with her team to work out a test plan, then closes her laptop.  
   
  
  
  
me:"I want to write good policy, and I'm going to guess that your team will have a reportable finding that you can tell the client tomorrow. I'm hoping this might make them listen to me"  
  
  
She looks dubious, but buys me sufficient mid grade booze to let me sleep.  
   
  
The next morning, I send a meeting request to Tormund and his boss to discuss a way forward. That meeting gets accepted, then cancelled due to a "more pressing security matter".  
   
  
I re-write the policy requiring unique passwords, validation of airgaps and failed login detection. I put a comment in the document about how these are 'reasonable' controls in an increasingly dangerous world. Nobody seems to quibble about this.  
   
  
Call before you dig, indeed.</td><td>My old boss did something like that a couple years ago.

So when the switch came back up, it was missing a bunch of things that were pretty much mission critical for that section of the plant.
He eventually got it reconfigured to the working setup and then got the IP cameras added successfully, but it took him a couple of days to get it all worked out. Somehow, in all that time since the previous configuration changes had been made, the switch had never gone down, so he had forgotten that the running config had never been saved to the startup config.</td><td>0.7640446904281684</td><td>0.0227817641136669</td><td>8</td></tr>

Background: My fiancé and I lived with my parents when we had our baby. We lived with them for the first five months of baby's life before getting our own place. The only reason for this was because our baby was a surprise and we had to wait until fiancé's lease ended at his place before getting a place of our own together. My MIL was very jealous of my parents getting to see baby every day. She tried to get fiancé to live with her again and it was all very dramatic. She even tried to take my fiancé's military housing benefit to buy herself a house that we can live in with her. That was super dramatic too. Anyways, she thought she wasn't seeing our baby as often as she wanted to because of our living situation with my parents. When we moved out and the frequency of her visits remained the same, she continued to be unhappy and decided to move across the country to where her other son has just moved to because he and his wife are due to have a baby this year and she wants to be overbearing with at least one of her grandchildren. Sorry SIL, it ain't gonna be my baby, haha.
Ever since BIL moved to their new location, the talk has started about us moving there too. We've always wanted to go there but at this point in time it's not in the plan. Our baby isn't a year old yet. I've still got a few classes left before finishing my bachelors. My fiancé still has a class before finishing his associates. He has an amazing job that has already given him a raise and he's been working there for a little over a year. There is a lot of potential growth. My parents and great grandmother are here and my baby LOVES them (we obviously love them too). And our friends are here. We've started our life here and BIL and MIL are blatantly disregarding that. They won't stop pressuring us to move across the country. 
MIL went house hunting there this week. She is single. She has kept saying "when you move you can live with me" and we either shrug her off or directly say we don't want to do that. And yet, she is interested in buying a home with a 2 bedroom basement apartment so that we can live with her.
The reason this bothers me, other than disregarding our life where we live now and our direct "NO," is the money. She is a very greedy person and when it comes to money, she'll find a way to get some out of a situation if she can. So knowing her, I'm afraid she's going to buy this big house for herself, and when we don't move there with her we'll never hear the end of it. "I got this big house for you guys and you aren't even coming" or worse, she'll pull the "I am your mother and I raised you by myself and I'm still trying to help you the least you could do is help pay for this house I got for us." (That was actually a very accurate statement that could come out of her mouth, if you all knew her you would be impressed with me lol). 
Obviously we won't owe her a dime. It's just annoying that in addition to being nagged to move, we will more than likely be nagged for money too. Just today my fiancé tried to open another savings account and was denied by his bank due to a poor financial report at another institution. He has no idea what it could be. He has amazing credit and no student loans. My spidey senses are going off and saying she did something in my fiancé's name. Wouldn't be the first time. If that is the case I'm hoping that will be an example for her as to why we aren't close to her. If it were up to me, I would do a lot to cut her off financially but my fiancé is very much in the fog. He took her off his main bank account but he won't take the identity protection steps he needs to take in order to protect himself since she has his social security number and can easily do shady things.
So yeah, here's to hoping she moves away and realizes that she doesn't need all that space when it will be her living there, ALONE, she'll save herself some money, and hopefully we won't hear about it.</td><td>Trustworthy?

This has probably been beaten to death but wondering who has made this change and what their experience was.
We are downsizing our datacenter and planning to move away from our chassis based 7ks and looking to possibly move towards a spine/leaf deployment that would consist of:
This would be a departure from what we are doing today with the 7k chassis (+12 FEX) and terminating all types of equipment on them (edge, storage, computer, etc..).  Our port density is rapidly decreasing as we migrate more and more to the cloud so having a chassis doesn't make sense.
But moving to the 9ks would be a pure spine + leaf whereas the core 9336s would only connect to the top of rack switches.  Everything would then terminate on a TOR.  If I did go with the above it would leave us with a ton (60) of unused ports on those 9336s as we would only be using 12 x 40/100g ports as uplinks to the TORs.  We would have no need for the remaining 60 ports as we don't have any 40/100g requirements and I don't see it changing in the future.
So my question is could we get away with running 93180YC-FX-24 at the core and TOS? That would limit the bandwidth to 3.6 Tbps across the board but it would eliminate the majority of 40/100g ports and leave us with a fair amount of 1/10/25.
Also I could do away with the TOS for the most part and just continue with the collapsed core and go with 2 x 93240YC-FX2 which would give me 48 x 1/10/25-Gbps fiber ports and 12 x 40/100-Gbps QSFP28 ports.
My main question is one architecture better than the other? IE spine + leaf vs collapsed core?  This is mainly going to server a lab/development environment and a compute + storage environment (1500+vms).  
My main goal is to keep this simple as its most likely not going to change anytime soon and the requirement is for at least 10 years of support.   Keep in mind we have the 7ks for 9 years and before that 6ks for 12 years.</td><td>ExpressRoute - need clarification/confirmation I have sifted through loads of documentation and a few YT videos, and I just need some clarification regarding the "2x /30s" piece to get the MS SLA.

Had some success with this using CSR1000v to do DMVPN with onprem ISR's, but getting just spoke to spoke working reliably has been difficult and I've all but given up on using the cloud as a DMVPN Hub. I need to review [user] 's links, hopefully I'll pick something up because otherwise hybrid cloud has been a pain and it feels ham-fisted trying to use things like virtual routers in cloud. Lots of dirty NAT's to force it into working the way you would onprem. Vnet to Vnet DMVPN is one of those hackey ways to force cloud to behave like onprem while lining Cisco's wallet. There are other "multicloud" options that work similarly under the hood because it's almost the only way to do it. Native tooling works better / is better integrated to cloud but is lacking when it comes to talking to onprem and other clouds, particularly when you'd like to interconnect using private WAN to give yourself options because anyone who's worth their salt has trust issues with the internet. The rock & hard place I keep running into is cloud to cloud over middlemile(L3VPN or VPLS with managed expressroute/directconnect landings in the underlay, etc) while encrypting everything between cloud to cloud and cloud to onprem to satisfy InfoSec/TheAuditors. The solution seems to be a DMVPN over the top but then I still have problems with device level fault detection / route propagation between my WAN and the L3 "switch" in each cloud. AzureRouteServer ought to help here, but last I knew it was still in beta. I think TransitGateway in AWS can do similar but havn't finished confirming my understanding of it. At the end of the day all this gets you is a traditional DMVPN with circa \~2010 management and relies on your routing protocol to detect and handle brownouts. SDWAN / multicloud options that integrate with things like AzureRouteServer have some promise, but I haven't confirmed they'd support using expressroute/directconnect as an underlay and their documentation diagrams don't indicate it as an option..
This link helped me get a CSR working over internet & private WAN;
The smart network dumb app approach that's traditionally been onprem doesn't work well in cloud but we're frequently told to move dumb apps up to the cloud regardless. When DR is restore this replica in another region but the app can't handle being re-IP'd without also being reinstalled the DR plan turns into "rebuild x app" and management doesn't like that answer.
At the end of the day it strikes me as a mismatch of requirements and capabilities, but ultimately mangelment says "go to the cloud!" because ExecWeekly said so and feels good about themselves moving the compute expense from the capital to the operational column of the budget sheet (even though it costs more since it's on 24/7 and doesn't scale) and we're left to deal with the fallout with our arms tied behind our backs.</td><td>ExpressRoute - need clarification/confirmation I have sifted through loads of documentation and a few YT videos, and I just need some clarification regarding the "2x /30s" piece to get the MS SLA.

So in your case, do your PAN, PSNs, then SAN. 
Since we don't want to leave our deployment in a mismatched patch state, I prefer to start with the PAN first and bring all nodes up to the PAN level to minimize and possible issues. 
With CLI patching it's all based on how you want to do it. Want to patch all four nodes at once? Go for it. Creates a larger impact to your environment though. With fully distributed deployments, I find if faster to batch patch based on design. Meaning do your Primaries, break up your PSNs into groups and patch each group at the same time, and followed lastly by the Secondaries. Decreases total patch time and potentially reduces impact. For your case you could do your PAN, then both PSNs at the same time, then SAN. 
One other note... you should be able to prestage your upgrade by reducing the transfer time in your change window or maintenance window by using your FTP to copy the file locally ahead of time, temporarily setting up a new repo called disk, mapped to your local disk, and then calling your patch install from the disk repo during the window.

Curious if anyone here has done this and may be able to explain how I can source my overlay VTI so that it's accessible over the internet to my other hubs and spokes.
I'm using a Catalyst 8000v in Azure and wish to include it as a hub in my existing DMVPN WAN -- typically on a physical router I land an internet link on a physical interface in a front door VRF with a public IP, and that is my tunnel source.  I'm having trouble translating this to how Azure preconfigures the router.
In this situation, I have spun up a vrouter that has one private NIC (member of NVASubnet) and one public IP, which appears to perhaps be a NAT of some sort because it is not an interface on the router..  I have Gi1 and a virtual interface with an arbitrary 192.168 IP I don't know the purpose of... It was just there when I spun up the box.
I found a couple of Cisco docs explaining that they have a preconfigured setup for V-Net to v-net DMVPN, but that's not what I am attempting to do and they don't show configuration examples.
Must I have two subnets with two interfaces and have a single public IP?  I am currently multihop eBGP peering over Gi1 with Azure RouteServer.  I am guessing I can source my VTI from the same interface since I have a PIP assigned but I'm not really sure.
Everything CAN be done through a single interface, but you don't want to do that because then you can't share a default route over this path.
Best way to do this is as follows:
Pre-work:  Configure a custom storage account so SERIAL CONSOLE access works.. you will need to make changes to the router out-of-band to get it set up correctly.
1).  Dedicate a subnet in Azure for public-facing (CiscoPublicSubnet), and one for azure-facing (CiscoPrivateSubnet) - make them both /28s (smallest you can make in Azure), and assign a NIC to each one
2).  Assign a Public IP to the NIC that's in your "CiscoPublicSubnet", then edit the NSG for this subnet so it allows 4500/500 UDP inbound/outbound
3).  Configure your front door VRF for your NIC in the "CiscoPublicSubnet" along with the VRF default route (this is so NHRP works).
4).  *IMPORTANT* - configure a RouteTable for your "CiscoPublicSubnet" and set up a rule in there called something like "INTERNET OVERRIDE" and create a UDR that matches the system defined "internet" route.  THE REASON WE DO THIS, is so if you ever share an on-prem default route into Azure, the actual "BGP" default route will get shared in and will actually override the System default, which will break the VRF default route used to build NHRP mappings.  Since UDR > BGP > System Defined, this UDR override protects DMVPN from this behavior.
5).  You must do eBGP multi-hop peering with Azure RouteServer since you cannot have your private NIC in the same subnet as "RouteServerSubnet" - make sure you put in static host routes on your DMVPN vRouter to the RouteServer peering IPs as to avoid any recursive routing once BGP stands up (you will see flapping if you don't put routes in).
6).  If ALSO using ExpressRoute... don't bother with any fancy BGP as-prepend route-maps or anything... they only come into play between 2x NVAs peering with RouteServer.  ExpressRoute has a higher "weight" for every prefix it shares with VNG, and Routeserver has a lower "weight" for every prefix it shares with VNG.  This means that *all identical prefixes being shared via ExpressRoute+DMVPN will choose ExpressRoute to get back on-prem* - if you need an active/active path where some traffic returns to on-prem over DMVPN while some goes ExpressRoute, your only tool is to manipulate prefix-lengths by summarizing from on-prem -> azure.</td><td>0.9123517296485166</td><td>0.4207227309766339</td><td>9</td></tr>

My current understanding is that the 2x /30s are to accommodate H/A for MS's edge routers - 2 BGP sessions, one goes down every now and then, but when it comes to configuration I have some questions.
I'm in a Colo facility with a single cross-connect to MSFT.  After provisioning, the ER "Private Peering" option (Since I am using Azure as IaaS) within the Azure ER config is asking me for 2x /30s and 1x VLANID.  I am guessing that on my physical Cisco router on-prem, I'd configure it like this?
I shouldn't be utilizing 2x separate VLAN IDs for these "primary/secondary" connections (which ride my 1x physical link), right?  The different VLAN ID's would be required for having multiple ER circuits within Azure?
Sorry if this sounds basic - FSR I thought multiple VLAN IDs were required when I provisioned the "connections" and now they're in an unprovisioned/error state (perhaps due to multiple VLAN IDs)  So I'm working with my Colo provider to get the "connections" cleaned up.  Not sure if related, but once that's cleaned up I want to ensure my understanding is complete before I reconfigure them.
I created connections with unique VLAN IDs on the Colo side and then put one VLAN ID in the Azure side, and I have L2 across to the ER circuit over both VLANs / can ping across both /30s.  It seems like as one commenter said, the VLAN ID in Azure is irrelevant (at least with Equinix).</td><td>0.9148257671194122</td><td>0.3299922909772448</td><td>9</td></tr>

I have on-prem connectivity built into Azure US East 2 and Central - each region has a hub/spoke Vnet model, and I have subnets cut out for PrivateLink (PaaS connectivity) in each applicable Vnet.
I'm already planning on making the apps geo-available to INTERNAL (on-prem) users with automatic failover by using a third party DNS/Priority based load balancing solution to steer users at the USE2 / USCE VMs in an Active/Standby scenario.
    if
    application <exampleapp.company.local> is available at US East 2, resolve to US East 2 app server IP
    else resolve to US Central app server IP
    endif
So, my question is how will Azure SQL need to be engineered into this?  This is where I need some clarification.
\- I currently understand that we can PrivateLink our SQL PaaS, so that it is reachable via IP addresses inside of the respective Vnets
\- I also understand that SQL geo-replication will leave my primary (USE2) DB as r/W, with the DR (USCE) DB being left in r/O state until failover occurs, at which point (UCSE) becomes r/W.
\- Both the r/W (US East 2) and r/O (US Central) databases could be accessible via PrivateLink IPs in their respective regions/Vnets --- is this correct??
...Given the above information, my first thought is to ensure both SQL servers have PrivateLink IPs, then have each app server's ODBC connection be configured to connect to its respective region's PrivateLink IP.   During a failure scenario, when SQL becomes unavailable in USE2, I just need to ensure that my DNS/Priority-based load balancing solution detects this and steers user traffic to the US Central app server
\^\^ Does this sound like the way to build this out?  Have any of you done cross-regional SQL PaaS with automatic failover?   If so, what have you done?</td><td>0.9164699070288488</td><td>0.3485325255592144</td><td>9</td></tr>

We want to enable multicast in vlan 3 only. From my research i learned that:

2. If the vlan is spanning across multiple switches then i need IGMP querier or i have to put vlan3 SVI into pim sparse-mode so that it handles igmp join and report across multiple switches and mark required ports as mrouter ports. 
q1. now my question is if I enable ip pim sparse-mode on the SVI for video vlan 3 (SVI resides on core switch in VSS mode) then would it leak multicast to other VLANS? 
q2. Or the leak would happens only when i enable pim sparse-mode on both SVI for vlan 3 (video vlan) and vlan 1 (data vlan)? 
q3. or would it be better that instead of enabling SVI for vlan 3 on core switch for pim sparse-mode i should create another SVI for vlan 3 on the access switch in that vlan and make it IGMP querier?
q4. if all the SVI for multiple vlans reside on the same switch and we enable ip pim on all the SVIs in that case layer 3 multicast work or we still have to enable ip mrouting on that switch? What i understand is we only have to enable ip mrouting if multicast is spanning 2 routers or 2 layer 3 switches.

Mira a cualquier show de televisión y los musulmanes siempre son árabes, barbudos, con mucho pelo, y piel brown. Si vas al medio oeste veras la diversidad de fenotipos. Hay gente rubia, negra, con ojos azules, marones y verdes etc. El país Con más musulmanes en el mundo es Indonesia. Muchos hay parecen chinos. No son una raza pero en la visualización y concepto Americano si son una raza. Ellos lo ven como raza. "The tall, bearded, brown, middle eastern looking dude". 
Su "profiling" en los aeropuertos y calles esta basado en fenotipos. Looks Arab? Get it. 
Los Israelitas critican mucho el sistema de identificar terrorista en Estados Unidos. Lo consideran ineficiente y innecesario. En Israel ellos hacen "profiling" dependiendo en "behavior" no en raza. 
Lo que quiero decir es que para los Americanos la gente del Medio Oriente son una raza. Su entendimiento de los diferentes grupos del mundo es basado en razas, ni cultura. Para ellos es White People, Black People, Hispanic People, Middle Eastern People and Asian people. All of them broad generalization about areas and phenotypes based what they see on tv.
Si alguien ve alguna persona y lo discrimina basado en los fenotipos presente pues son racistas. Si alguien discrimina alguien basado en la cultura son xenofobicos. Los dos están mal.</td><td>Bueno, tu piensas que todo Latinoamerica es una colonia mientras que esos paises se consideran a si mismos libres.

    vpc domain 1

I want each N7K to peer with the router, but not with each other.  I configured a VLAN, but I can't tag that vlan to the VPC without passing it on the peer-link, and the moment I do, the two N7K's peer with one another.
Can't do HSRP for the same reason.
I tried dropping the Layer3 IP directly on the port channel, let's say /29 with the two N7K's being 1 and 2, with the router being 6.  This almost looks like it works, except 1 and 6 won't peer with one another, going to RTO 5000 each time.

Since you're talking PVLAN I assume you have physical servers.  This will work.  You could open up E-W between two hosts by using dedicated NICs and plugging them into a dedicated VLAN so they have a different L2 path, but then no filtering is possible without host firewalling...
Host firewalling is the answer here.  It's the best choice for the inevitable ask for E-W traffic and doesn't compromise flexibility in your network.</td><td>0.9298791860173024</td><td>0.4833814028766261</td><td>9</td></tr>

But I've run into a strange problem that I've spend several hours on and I really can't figure this one out.
I use VMWare ESXi on a Dell R820 Server for this lab. The server is connected to a regular residential ISP modem (via some cisco layer 3 witches).   I have made a quick schema (<URL>) to make my setup more clear. But it is basically Ubuntu Desktop VM -> PFSense VM -> PaloAlto VM -> ISP Modem -> internet.
The issue that I have is that the Ubuntu VM (Ubuntu01 in the schema) cannot access the internet in any way. No ping, no dns, no nothing. But the strange part is that the Ubuntu VM can ping the ISP modem (192.168.0.1), so the traffic is routed as it should through the  PFSense and PaloAlto. During my troubleshooting I tried to attach the (same) Ubuntu VM to the portgroup that connects the PFSense to the PaloAlto and from there it can access the internet just fine (Ubuntu02 in the schema).
It is just a lab, I know I don't need the PFSense and everything would work just fine if I let the Palo handle everything. But I would like to understand what is happening.
EDIT: I have changed the 10.17.5.0/30 subnet to a /29 subnet to avoid conflicts with the ubuntu2 and the /30 broadcast address

Recently I had an ISE question about the RC4 support ending for AD, the engineer responded and didn't answer my question, so then I asked again and they linked me to community forum posts that I already read that didn't have a clear answer, so I asked again, and if he could lab it in order to get the correct answer.</td><td>0.7879686863767581</td><td>0.2501525994085272</td><td>9</td></tr>

How many formerly idealistic people go to university and become entranced by ridiculous, impractical ideas trying to pass themselves off as "common sense"? This might be a controversial statement (then again if you're an HDM fan you are assumedly the kind of person who welcomes controversy), but people who become fans of Ayn Rand during their university intellectual/philosophical phase are a good example. I recall my *alma mater* was (partly due to its funding sources) rather notable for its Economics department embracing and promoting a lot of Libertarian ideas (which went to such lengths as hosting guest speakers on topics such as "is sweat shop labor a net good for society?") and there were students who got swept up in those notions in such a way that they came across as soulless automatons, likely distanced from the kind of people they were in the past. Frankly, it doesn't seem like much of a stretch to imagine Lyra taking a similar trajectory.
One of the main strengths of the book is that it's not afraid to take a step back and reflect on the so-called "marketplace of ideas": particularly those the original trilogy sold in the form of an anti-theist, neo-Enlightenment message. *The Secret Commonwealth* takes a look at some of the grimmer implications in Pullman's own work, particularly the implicit void that might be found in the idea of (both literally and metaphorically) "killing God" and allowing humans, as individuals, to choose their own path based on free will. The original trilogy had a lot of ideas to endlessly pick over and talk about, and *The Secret Commonwealth* adds yet another layer to the narrative that is equally worthy of discussion.
The only low point of *The Secret Commonwealth* was the gratuitous scene with the Turkish soldiers near the end. Completely unnecessary unless you want to justify it as showing that "the world is a brutal place" or some similar idea.</td><td>Most airbenders (all known cannon air-nomads/airbenders except Kyoshis mom and Aang himself) are both airbenders and have relationships with air-nomads. The fire nation wiped out every airbender from the temples. It is a good point that there very well could have been air-nomads who were off temple during the attacks and possibly have children who are airbenders. However, look how hard the fire nation was trying to find and kill the avatar. Im pretty sure they would have traced lineage, and attempted to track down every recorded airbender on the planet, possibly and probably killing anyone with even remote ties or lineage to an airbender. When conducting genocide, you usually don't take half measures. Basically; genetically airbenders were very centralized and didn't have relationships often with non-airbenders. And second, the fire nation was actually hunting their biggest threat to power, the avatar, and was conducting ethic cleansing to find him, which would most likely track down descendants and off temple airbenders.
Edit: haven't finished Yangchen books so if there are other airbenders in relationships with non-airbenders I am unaware of that. However, unless there is major cannon changing events in Yangchen to disprove what I said in the original comment, I stand by my point.</td><td>0.7879712728916335</td><td>0.0467587814816019</td><td>9</td></tr>

Several years ago I worked as desktop support for a hospital system.  I got my job because this system had just purchased a small community hospital in the middle of nowhere and they only had one IT guy to begin with, so I came in as backup so to speak.  Some years prior the community hospital had contracted with another local doctor to set up a cancer treatment center.  Again, small community in the middle of nowhere.  The treatment center was kind of a joke, but it did exist.  The contract was about as poorly written as it gets.  The hospital gave him the building and paid for the initial equipment, he maintained 51% of the business.  He also did his own IT work and the hospital "would provide computer support as needed".  That was the actual clause in the contract, so often times we would get called for things we had no business touching and it would start a fight because I didn't know how to work on a spectrometer.  One day I get a call, and it goes a little something like this:
$doc = "Doctor who knows just enough to be dangerous"
$doc:  "Hey!  So...Windows XP is going out of support.  I bought all new SSDs, flashed the new Windows onto them, and replaced all the hard drives in my building at once without testing, and now I have a machine that doesn't work.  Come fix it!"
The problem was that he had a piece of diagnostic software that would no longer work properly post-upgrade.  All kinds of weird things going wrong with it.  Doctor just says "It won't work".  I called vendor support and, after about ten minutes of this guy getting more and more confused that I don't have the buttons and fields I should have, he asks for the version.
$me:  "Well, doc, I'm sorry, but I can't help you.  If I was able to both A) Understand medical diagnostics at that level and B) Completely rewrite the source code of a medical diagnostic application and make it work properly and securely, I sure wouldn't be working here.  You gotta upgrade."
$doc:  "Hey!  I think I found a way to fix that software!  But now I can't get out to the internet.  I need you to come fix it"
$doc:  "So...the problem was that it wouldn't run properly on the new windows, so I installed virtual box on the machine and put Windows XP on the vm, and installed the software there.  It launches properly now!  Unfortunately the license for the software is tied to the mac address of the computer, so I had to change the mac address of the vm to match the license so I could get it to launch, but now it can't get out to the internet.  I need you to fix it."
I didn't even respond.  I just gave him a deadpan stare and then walked away.  Last I knew he left the new Windows SSD in and swapped out to the old hard drive when he needed to use the software.  Shortly before I left the organization they had forced him out for various hippa violations and completely reworked the office into a proper facility.
Edit: Realized I typed Windows 7 instead of Windows XP.</td><td>50dB is roughly normal ambient noise in a typical house. With exposure over sufficient time, above 70dB can cause damage (70dB is about the level of the average office), but 95dB is where it starts being painful for most people with normal hearing, and from that point, as it gets louder, permanent hearing damage occurs more rapidly.
I would get a free noise meter app for your phone, and start measuring when he cranks it past 11. If your phone is Apple or Samsung, the numbers should be pretty accurate; some phones use an automatic gain control on the microphone which can cause the readings to be pretty inaccurate. Occasional spikes up to 70dB or 75dB are pretty normal, but sustained noise above 70 is probably enough to break the CC&R; above 80dB sustained I think would definitely run afoul of the rules.
Record dates and times along with readings. If you can record video of each event, including the readout of the noise meter app, it might make it apparent to the HOA that this is a real problem.

Ensured all VLANs on the Cisco side have a higher (worse) priority than the HP Core MST config.
VLAN 1 on Cisco is showing the HP core as root bridge, and itself root for all other VLANs. Is this expected behavior, or **should all VLANs show the HP / MST0 switch as root?** 
My understanding is that some time of simulation occurs to allow STP modes to speak which is communicated only over VLAN 1. I was expecting the HP to still show as root for all VLANs, but I suppose this makes sense. Is there a good way to confirm a healthy configuration via debug or show commands?

First,  remove all Intel Pentium and Celeron computer processor chips from  personal computers (desktops, laptops and notebooks) as these were  either developed or manufactured in Israel.
Note that the  revolutionary new Ivy Bridge processor will be manufactured in  Israel. Any computers running the Windows XT operating system must be  turned off immediately as this was developed in Israel. All current  Microsoft operating systems are not to be used as Microsoft is heavily  reliant on its Israel R&D centre.
**Step 2**.  Any computers that still work need to have their anti-virus software  and personal firewalls removed as this technology originated in Israel.  The organisation's firewall will also need to be switched off. Staff  should no longer open external emails as most of these will be infected  with viruses. No outgoing emails can be sent. The algorithm (code)  that's used today for sending e-mails, was made by an Israeli who worked  at the Ben-Gurion University in Be'er-Sheva in 1980.
**Step 3**.  Discard all mobile phones, as this technology was developed in Israel,  where the first mobile phones were manufactured. Mobile chip technology  from a single Israeli company has now been installed in over 100 million  devices. Only top-level staff may retain mobile phones for emergency  situations. However the use of SMS (Texting) is expressly forbidden as  this facility was developed in Israel. No 4G devices can be used, as the  chipset is Israeli.
**Step 4**. Turn off  your voice-mail service and delete any recorded messages. Israeli  companies invented the voice-mail system. If someone you do not know  answers your phone-call, then hang up. Israeli call-centres and  call-centre technology is in widespread operation in the UK.
**Step 5**.  Before accepting any printed material, check that the supplier has not  used the Israeli device that might have saved up to 50% of the ink used.
**Step 6**.  At home, do not use Facebook as many in-built and add-on applications  are Israeli-developed. Do not watch videos on the Internet as the  platform used to upload them may be from AOL and hence from an Israeli  company. Do not use the Internet to search for answers to your questions  as this may involve use of an Israeli-developed search engine. Better  to remain unenlightened.
**Step 7**. On your  TV or home entertainment centre, do not use Video On Demand (VOD) to  watch movies as you may inadvertently see an advert displayed  using Israeli software. Do not purchase any games devices as these are  likely to use Israeli technology.
**Step 8**.  Do not read books using an e-book as this may contain Israeli  technology. Do not use data storage as it may have been developed at  Israel's storage technology R&D center.
**Step 9**.  Do not buy an electric car as it is likely to be powered with  an Israeli battery or use Israeli developed charging mats. Continue to  sit in traffic knowing that you are polluting the environment and  financing oil-rich despotic regimes.
Turning to  food and drink, all food outlets on the organisation's premises must  dispose of cherry tomatoes, which were developed in Israel. Staff must  ensure that no cherry tomatoes are included in sandwiches brought into  office premises. The ban also applies to honey and any products derived  from honey. Israel has developed solutions to the worldwide problem of  bee-colony collapse, so that any products derived from bees might only  be available now due to an Israeli invention.
Avoid  drinking any of the world-recognized award-winning Israeli wines. Do not  consume homemade drinks from Israeli-manufactured household drinks  machines.
Avoid any fruit from South Africa or Peru as produce from these countries is being marketed with Israeli brand names.
No  agricultural products from the following areas must be consumed as they  use water irrigation and agricultural technology provided directly from  Israel. This includes most of Africa, China, India, Indonesia (a Muslim  country), Nepal and many others.
Much fruit and  vegetables (including organic) imported into the UK has been enhanced  using Israeli technology. This may save millions of people from starving  around the world, but is not a good reason for you to eat it. To be  safe, only eat fruit and vegetables that you have grown yourself using  seeds that have been in your family for generations.
Destroy  all personal medication. Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals, the largest  generic drugs company in the world, will have manufactured many of your  medicines.  Staff with the following illnesses will need to take  specific precautions.
Cancer – do not take any form of  medication or treatment. Israeli scientists have been working at the  forefront of oncology for decades.
AIDS and HIV – beware;  researchers at Israel's Weizmann Institute or Hebrew University  developed or improved AZT and Hypericin-based drugs; they have also  developed a treatment that destroys HIV-infected cells without damaging  healthy ones.
Diabetes – do not measure or inject Insulin using the devices developed by Israeli scientists.
Multiple  Sclerosis – stop taking Copaxone, one of the most efficient medicines  and the only non-interferon agent, as Teva developed it.  Don't  touch Laquinimod either.
Parkinson's – remove the  Israel-pioneered brain pacemaker to stop tremors. Discontinue Levodopa,  which reduces motor disturbances. Cease sessions that involve magnetic  cortex stimulation.
Staff with a family history of heart  disease and arteriosclerosis must not use the Israeli device for early  detection of these.  Rather, wait until onset of the disease.
Epileptics  – stop treatment that may have benefited from the Israeli discovery of  the underlying mutant gene; also throw away the bracelet that sends out  an alert when a person goes into seizure.
Staff or relatives with Age-related Macular Degeneration – remove Israeli implants that arrest the disease.
Liver disease – abandon Israeli-developed antibody immunotherapy treatments.
Emphysema – steer clear of the Israeli protein replacement therapy.
Myeloma – stop taking the drug Velcade, which was developed over a period of 30 years by scientists at Haifa.
Sleep apnea – no tests using the breakthrough Israeli device for diagnosis.
Dyslexics must not benefit from the Israeli Internet-based reading system.
Skin allergies must be treated with steroid creams only, as the new safer non-steroid alternative is Israeli.
Any  incident of stroke or head trauma or onset of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,  MS, epilepsy, glaucoma or brain tumor must avoid using any of the  Weizmann Institute's patented methods of treatment.
Before  any surgery or medical tests, check that hospital catheters have not  been protected from infection using the new plastic from Israel that  disables microorganisms. Avoid throat surgery as this may utilize  Israeli surgical lasers.
Ensure any colonoscopy or gastro  investigation does not use internal Israeli cameras such as the  Pillcam.  Never undergo surgery to install an artificial heart, as the  first artificial heart transplant took place in Israel.
Kidney  transplant patients must wait for donors of the same blood group as  only Israel's revolutionary new methods allow donors from other blood  groups.  Staff of Arab origin must not make use of the only database for  matching potential Arab donors of bone-marrow – in Israel.
In  the event of a spinal injury or disease, do not accept spinal  implants – likely to be an Israeli product or development. Heart rhythm  problems must not be solved with the Israeli-developed heart pulse  generator. All heart stents are off-limits as most of these originate  from Israeli medical companies.
Check all vaccines as many  of these have been developed in Israel.  Ensure that all X-rays do  carry a radiation risk, as the only radiation-free system is  Israeli.  Treatments derived from Stem Cell research must be avoided  as most of these are Israeli-developed.
If you or your  family are struck with a bacterial infection, do not take alternatives  to older, ineffective bacteria-resistant antibiotics, as an  Israeli discovery will have been responsible for the modern, effective  drugs. Check that any pain relief medication is not based on soya as an  Israeli doctor discovered the beneficial effect of the soya bean.
Do  not use the revolutionary new Israeli bandage that saved the life of  Arizona senator Gabriella Giffords after she was shot in the head.  If  you break a bone badly, reject any treatment that involves introducing  collagen, as this may have been manufactured from Israeli plants.
Do not protect babies and infants from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome with the Babysense system from Israel.
Do not use Epilady (or epilator) – two Israelis invented this hair removal device.
Finally, reject all major dental treatment, as your teeth may need to be scanned with an Israeli-developed dental scanner.
When  interviewing prospective new staff or holding meetings with members of  the public or with individuals from other companies, it is vital that  you check whether they originate from, or are associated with the  following countries and areas. You must ensure that you do not have any  contact with people who have benefited from Israel's aid to those  countries. The organization must avoid any possible acknowledgment of  Israel's contribution to world relief.   In addition, you must obtain a  formal statement from the government of these countries that Israeli aid  was not responsible for the production or development of any goods and  services supplied to the organization.

Pakistan (2005) and Peru (2007) both accepted aid from Israeli NGOs following earthquake disasters.
Peru's hydro-electric power plants are also being built and run by an Israeli company.
Rawanda, Mexico, Chad,  Sudan (Darfur) and Malawi all have received humanitarian aid from  Israel, including medical assistance from Israel's NGO IsraAID.
Always  remember that the boycott extends to any individuals from the above  regions that have been exposed to Israeli assistance during the 63 years  existence of the current Jewish State.
\-Reject  all products from the USA. Analysis conducted in a typical US  stateshows that Israeli innovations were responsible for $2.4 billion in  direct revenue to that state's economy in 2009 and generated nearly  6,000 jobs.
\-Do not tutor your children in advanced  Mathematics techniques, which may have originated in Israel. Also, if  these techniques are used in your children's schools, withdraw your  children immediately.
\-Keen ornithologists should consider  giving up their hobby as many rarespecies stop off or reside in Israel  during their twice-yearly migration.
\-Do not watch the new series of NCIS as one of the actresses is Israeli.
\-Avoid going to any football matches featuring teams with Israeli players.
\-Destroy  all your recordings of Madonna, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Deep  Purple, Bon Jovie, Justin Bieber, George Benson, Moby and many, many  more artists who have ridiculed the illogical boycott and have proudly  performed (or will shortly perform) concerts in Israel.
\-Destroy  any recordings of U2, Lady Gaga, Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, Beck,  Rihanna Coldplay and any artist whose music has been recorded using  the sound technology of the Grammy Award winning Israeli company Wave  Audio. You also must get rid of any personal copies of *Shrek*,*American Beauty* and *Star Wars*. Do not trust anything recorded by Sony, JVC, Toshiba or Dell.
\-Don't go to see *The Black Swan* with Natalie Portman, or watch any old films with Elizabeth Taylor – both lovers of the Jewish State.
\-Do not stay in hotels or visit shopping centers owned by Israeli companies (sorry, you will need to check which ones yourself).
\-Do not have anything to do with the banks who are using Israeli software to prevent fraud.
\-Do  not use any credit or debit card as the Security monitoring system used  by the credit card companies is likely to be Israeli.
\-Do not buy an engagement ring containing a diamond as it is possible that this may have been cut in Israel.
\-Do not travel by air, as your plane might get towed by the Israeli-built "Taxibot."
\-Do not use public transport inside Amsterdam, Moscow or Northern Chinain case you benefit from Israeli transportation devices.
\-If  you suffer a power or network failure, be grateful that at least you  haven't installed the Israeli system that prevents power outages.
\-Finally,  you need to leave all your taps running when you leave home and must  never flush your  toilet, because Israel provides water-saving technology to over half of  the planet. It also is providing sewage treatment technology across the  world, including to the UK. It should be obvious by now that all the  measures specified in Parts 1 – 4 of this series of blogs will  inevitably mean that your organization and your staff will be completely  unable to function.  Let's therefore hope that the decision by your  organization to boycott Israeli products is flushed down the toilet of  history.

From  1966 onward Coca-Cola has been a  staunch supporter of Israel. Recently  the Government of Israel Economic  Mission honored Coca-Cola at the  Israel Trade Award Dinner for its  continued support of Israel for the  last 30 years and for refusing to  abide by the Arab League boycott of  Israel.
NESTLE
Swiss food giant Nestle will set up a   global research and development center for snack foods next year in   Sderot, a town in Israel's Negev desert, the Maariv newspaper reported   on Sunday. Nestle owns 50.1 percent of Israeli food maker Osem   Investments and the two together produce snack foods at a plant in   Sderot.
DISNEY
The Disney Company is owned by Jewish  Mogul  Michael Eisner. He owns a vast media empire that includes the  ABC  television network, numerous news dailies, national magazines,  Hollywood  film companies and a large number of radio stations. One  radio station  in Los Angeles, KABC 790 AM recently broadcast comments  by Jewess Gloria  Alred to the effect that the Islamic prisoners at  Guantanamo should be  tortured by having their "balls" extracted with  pliers in order to make  them talk. The news and commentaries made  through Michael Eisner's media  octopus are extremely Islamophobic and  anti-Palestinian.
KIMBERLY-CLARK
In 1998 Mr. Robert  P. Van der Merwe,  chairman of Kimberly-Clark Europe received the  Jubilee Award by the  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. This is the  highest tribute ever  awarded by the "State of Israel" in recognition of  those individuals and  organizations, that through their investments  and trade relationships,  have done the most to strengthen the Israeli  economy.

**I think, you need the whole world to boycott All these Israeli Products. If you can! Haha.**</td><td>The idea that "Democrats are conservatives in Europe" is a Reddit meme that is at best half true. Some aspects of the role of government are just different in Europe, and that's fine. In particular, both the employer-employee relationship (limits on hours, rules about wages, required time off, etc.) and healthcare systems are just different as a norm. It's not so much that the conservatives in Europe don't support privatizing health insurance, as much as it is that this just isn't a political position that is discussed. Some of this is just cultural. For example, a policy to only allow government communications, schools, and businesses in the dominant language would be called "racist" by the American left, but is accepted in France. 
However, there are many mainstream positions in Europe that are far closer to the American right in other issues. You already mentioned immigration. European taxes are less progressive than American taxes but the Democrats want to tax the rich even more (in fact, as measured by how much tax the rich pay, the US has the most progressive tax system in the OECD). Countries like Sweden have privatized pensions and what we would call school choice, where parents can direct government money to private schools instead of public ones. 
Many Democrats in the US support positions that are left of Europe, such as wealth taxes, apportioning government benefits based on race, outlawing gas cars, or disfavoring merit-based immigration.
In reality, the cultures are just different. Europeans prefer a larger government in general, which is fine. But it's not as simple as saying that Republicans are off the chart to the right in Europe on all issues.</td><td>0.7879822523458907</td><td>0.1705653495768863</td><td>9</td></tr>

Sounds like we just need to get some time today to get with her and solution whatever challenges she's having and make sure we can best support her until we can get a dedicated office built. (filming activity is happening all around the building today, so it's another complication)

> Yeah, the headset itself was broken. I tried swapping out all the cables, no fix, so I swapped the headset base and the headset itself, and it worked.
The headsets were purchased by $Sales without consulting anyone else. This is about the 5th ticket that I've received around issues with them (*I know nothing about them*), and yet the first about this specific issue (despite it having been "going on for weeks"). No one knows what kind of warranty they have, where the batch that hers came from was purchased, etc. There is no serial number on the outside of the box, which means the S/N would not have been logged by Receiving, and a PO was never made for them, which means that we literally have no way to figure out where they came from.  
The phone in the engineering lab was taken by a user and sitting on his desk (despite being labeled "Engineering Lab" on the screen).

After the [previous] gig, I'm told to get myself to a suburban office park somewhere in Missouri and join an existing engagement with Amalgamated Pipelines (AP).  
  
  
  
It's late Spring, so business travel becomes an excuse to ride my motorcycle. A day and a half later, I'm at my second home- a mid-grade hotel chain with the amenities I want- room service, a small hotel bar with a familiar point of sale system.  
  
  
I check in, clean up and park myself at the bar, which is sparsely occupied. I drop my laptop at the bar and start reading through the documents from the client as well as previous emails.  
   
  
Looks like Amalgamated has decided to assess and fix their cybersecurity in a few weeks, like cleaning up from a week long house-party fifteen minutes before Mom & Dad come home.  
  
  
I've been tasked with writing an entire policy kit this week. There's an external team doing some kind of vulnerabilty scan, but I'm not involved. My firm is also doing some consulting around restructuring financial stuff, but I skip over those threads.  
  
  
I find the docs I am interested in- network and infrastructure. Their regular IT network looks like late 90's state of the art- MPLS WANs between offices. The Industrial Control Systems (ICS) networks are much less detailed- the top level diagram of the whole network looks like marketing material- it's not a hastily pushed together Visio doc, but without specifics. There's some spreadsheet as an inventory- devices and locations and 172.16.x.x addresses.  
   
  
Ok. I do notice that they've handed over _nothing_ for the usual policies & procedures. I'll just buy one of those off the shelf policy kits and get AP to let me know what they don't, can't or won't do.  
   
  
It's imperfect, but that's what you get when you only have a week.  
   
  
A few more people find their way to the hotel bar, and we're all living the same life. Laptops and drinks. I notice one laptop across the bar from me with a variety of hacker conference stickers. The owner is a 30 something woman picking at a plate of fries and pipetting drops of water into a glass of scotch while staring at her screen.  
  
  
I go back to my room and slap together some slides describing my part of this project for tomorrow's kickoff and go to bed.  
  
  
The next morning, I boil water with the in-room coffee maker to make oatmeal, and make it to Amalgamated's offices.  
  
  
I get to meet the teams. My firm has a handful of management consultants, but I'm the only IT or security consultant. There's another firm doing a pentest. After the initial kickoff meeting, I'll get to try to coordinate with the handful of people I need to talk to. I'd expect to overlap with the pentest team to save time.  
  
  
Right as the meeting starts, I see the Scotch-drinking woman from the bar and her bestickered laptop. There are intros and a lot of backstory about Amalgamated. I really don't care, but I want to look attentive and easy to work with.  
  
  
After the meeting, I meet Ralph, Amalgamated's Director of IT. He wants to make sure I  get settled in. I follow him through a maze of mouse-colored cubicles. I think I'm in a sales or customer service phone bank as the people around me are busy taking short phone calls. Ralph has a neutral American accent, which makes me guess he's either from Central Ohio or he's suppressing a thicker accent.  
   
  
This distracts me. I want to force him to say "to be" or "needs done" and solve this mystery. After some chit-chat in his office, we agree on the plan- I'm going to give him parts of the generic policy and he'll assign Amalgamated staff to make comments. Once we collect all their inputs, I'll edit the policies and they can sign off on them. The next week will be spent poking people, fighting over wording and writing.  
   
  
Policy writing ain't easy but it's necessary. I'll be chasing stakeholders like Tom chased Jerry.  
  
  
The first day, it's sending emails and editing the policy template. I'm mostly changing names, titles and commenting out things Amalgamated doesn't handle, like credit cards or healthcare data. This isn't complicated work, so I get to take in my surroundings. Most of the people at Amalgamated have worked here for years. Their cubes are decorated with plaques showing how long they've been there. During coffee breaks, I wander around to see many five and ten year plaques of different colors. I'll have to ask Ralph when I talk to him next.  
  
  
Most of the office empties out at 4:55, but one woman in a cube near me sticks around.  
  
  
I try listening into her calls. Maybe she's renting real estate on the side. Her calls start out with narrowing down a particular property and then telling them either "you're OK" or "we'll be out there within 48 hours. Don't do any work in the area until we're there".  
  
  
Fine. I've done my day's work, so I leave Amalgamated. The parking lot's empty, so I deliberately ride over the speed bumps fast enough to catch air.  
  
  
Simple pleasures, like a dinner at Waffle House and a book. I ride back to the hotel and park myself in the bar to have a drink and catch up on other work.  
   
  
After a beer or two and some timesheets, I notice Scotch & Water at the bar. I wave to her and manage a brief conversation:  
  
  
me:"Hey- I saw you at the kickoff- looking at your stickers, you're on the pentest?"  
  
  
  
  
me:"Great. I'm writing policies this week. Did you get any details on their ICS systems? All I saw was marketing material"  
  
  
  
  
me:"I'd like to believe that, but I'd like to believe a lot of things that aren't true"  
  
  
  
  
I leave her be, finish my drink and go up to my room.  
  
  
Oddly enough, I've already received some comments on my drafts. Most of them are the usual- changes for people's titles, nitpicky comments on wording.  
  
  
And an odd one. In the Network Security Policy, there was a section that read like it was from the early 90's:  
  
  
  
  
"Any system with a dial-up connection shall use an unique password before being connected to the telephone network"  
  
  
I figured this wasn't relevant, so I commented with a terse:"I'm pretty sure you're not using dialup any more, so I'd suggest removing this or limiting it to fax/multifunction printers"  
  
  
This seems to be a controversial topic. This has sparked an entire back and forth between a few Amalgamated staff which comes to a conclusion that the Industrial Control Systems team can't meet this for all their dial-up systems and that it's overly burdensome to fix.  
  
  
This keeps me up at night. What sort of stuff do they have on dialup?  
  
  
The next morning, I get my coffee and park myself in my cubicle. Before the calls start, I poke my head over the cubicle wall and introduce myself to my office neighbor.  
   
  
me:"Hi there. I'm just a contractor working with you all. What are you all doing?"  
  
  
My neighbor looks at me and cocks her head to the side, like I asked a _really_ dumb question.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Neighbor:"We've got maps of all our buried assets. When someone wants to dig, they call us and we let them know if we need to mark the property."  
  
  
She points at a map of what looks like the western halves of Missouri.  
  
Neighbor:"I'm responsible for the MOARLA corridor. Candy, next cube over is responsible for Texas and New Mexico"  
  
  
I look at the map on her cubicle and see lines crossing Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana. There are details as well. I see components of the pipelines and other details in small print.  
  
  
I hear a voice booming behind me. It comes from a large, bearded man who consciously flexes his muscles. I know he has an axe. I just hope it isn't in his office. I'll call him Tormund.  
   
  
  
  
  
  
Tormund:"I need you to be more reasonable with your policies"  
  
  
  
  
Tormund:"Unique passwords are too hard to manage. Our systems aren't connected to the Internet, so it doesn't matter. I also want the airgap testing requirement out of the policy"  
  
  
  
  
Tormund:"Yes. I'm a manager in the Industrial Controls department."  
  
  
  
  
   
  
I'm imagining what's going on in his head. It's not pretty.  
  
  
I put my hands up.  
  
  
me:"You say your systems are airgapped, but won't test to make sure"  
  
  
Tormund's nostrils flare.  
  
 
Tormund:"If you can't read the diagram we sent you, we should replace you with someone who can"  
   
  
me:"Look, I'll figure out who can sign off on this. I'll let you know"  
  
  
Tormund grunts and walks off. This is going to be fun.  
   
  
Thankfully the rest of the day is filled with less threatening meetings, comments on documents and listening into the "Call before you dig" calls.  
  
  
One caller seems to be a bit demanding. This reminds me of my help desk days. I can't hear the caller, but I can hear Candy's voice.  
  
  
Candy:"Sir, I understand that it's your land. We bought the rights to have a pipeline there"  
  
  
  
  
  
Candy:"Let me assure you, if you dig through our 12 inch pipeline, damage to your auger is the least of your worries."  
  
  
We all have a laugh at this. Candy seems to have calmed down her angry Texan.  
  
  
Everybody filters out by 5, but I'm still waiting on some edits before I leave. I take the opportunity to walk through the cube maze.  
  
  
I stop at Candy's cube and look at her map to get an idea how these pipelines work. Pipelines are layered networks. At the bottom of their OSI model, there are long tubes filled with petroleum products. On top of them are thin electrical networks to power pumps, sensors and valves and their controllers. On top of that, there's a conventional network controlling all this.  
  
  
That network runs back to control buildings.  
   
  
All this makes sense to me. There are faint notes on the map as well. I note many of the controllers have four or ten digit numbers faintly written next to them.  
  
  
I look around, then take a few pictures with my phone.  
  
  
My phone buzzes. It's a demanding email from the Director of Industrial Controls, who I assume is Tormund's boss. Since their systems are airgapped, they feel that it's absolutely ridiculous that they should have to meet unreasonable standards, let alone let those standards be written down in a policy document. More than a few people at my firm are cc'd.  
  
  
I've had enough for the day. I go back to the hotel, change and try to find decent barbecue. Sadly, all I can find is a Bandana's, which will have to suffice.  
  
  
As I see it, I'm either going to have to go to my boss and get some cover or capitulate to the ICS Wildlings.  
  
  
I plead with the waitress to bring me a plain seltzer, even trying to explain that the little switch on the side of the dispenser can be used to make this.  
  
  
She brings me a Sprite and I am sad.  
   
  
I'm mashing at my phone, getting sweet barbecue sauce on the screen when the picture of the map from Candy's cubicle comes up. Out of idleness, I swipe around the map of Texas.  
  
  
I don't know why I write down the number written on the map. I really don't know why I decide to call it.  
  
  
It answers after three rings.  
   
  
EoooooEEEEEEEoooooHHHHHHH ping ping ping ping.  
  
  
I'm a kid of the 90's. I know what a modem attempting a handshake sounds like.  
   
  
I use a few napkins and the cup of Sprite to wash my hands, I drop more than sufficient money on the table and run out of the restaurant. I pull on my helmet, jacket and gloves and make good time back to the hotel. I run to my room before taking off my helmet.  
   
  
Fifteen minutes and twenty dollars later in the hotel's business center, I have printed off Candy's map. I sit at the bar, drinking cold seltzer and calling up modems, marking the results on the printout. A few turn out to be actual humans in a port facility or control room. Some guessing later and I figure out the area codes and exchanges for most of the other numbers on the map.  
  
  
I'm practically spinning on my barstool. I see Scotch & Water walk into the bar. I walk over to her disappointment.  
  
  
me:"How would you like some high findings on your pentest report?"  
  
  
Her annoyance turns into amusement as I walk her through what I found out, including dialing one of the modems.  
    
   
She opens her laptop and starts chatting with her team to work out a test plan, then closes her laptop.  
   
  
  
  
me:"I want to write good policy, and I'm going to guess that your team will have a reportable finding that you can tell the client tomorrow. I'm hoping this might make them listen to me"  
  
  
She looks dubious, but buys me sufficient mid grade booze to let me sleep.  
   
  
The next morning, I send a meeting request to Tormund and his boss to discuss a way forward. That meeting gets accepted, then cancelled due to a "more pressing security matter".  
   
  
I re-write the policy requiring unique passwords, validation of airgaps and failed login detection. I put a comment in the document about how these are 'reasonable' controls in an increasingly dangerous world. Nobody seems to quibble about this.  
   
  
Call before you dig, indeed.</td><td>That sounds like a variation of Management Stack Theory, courtesy of BOFH. The idea is that many people only have so much space in their mental process stacks, and that anything that pushes over that limit causes a stack reset, which results in an undefined mental stack state. It could be cleared out, or it could be a complete pig's breakfast of whatever was in the stack at the time of the reset, including the item that caused the reset. Simon Travaglia has a much better description of the phenomenon, plus a great working example.
You have to give those people little bits of the process at a time, because larger, more abstract statements use up much more stack and lead to sooner resets.</td><td>0.7879951205974307</td><td>0.1511243620789579</td><td>9</td></tr>

[EDITS: spelling and embellishment of the tale, if I'm honest.]</td><td>Sometime in 2005 or early 2006, I was traveling for work. I had been in Denver for a couple of days, and then flew into Beverly Hills for a day. Got in late evening, had my hotel reservation printed out. Get to the hotel, and not only did they not have my reservation, but they were also completely booked for that night. My boss had used Expedia to make all the travel arrangements (as he did regularly), but Expedia hadn't sent the reservation to the hotel. I was at the right place, but Expedia screwed up.
I called my boss (who was 3 hours ahead), I called Expedia, my boss called Expedia, Expedia called the hotel and tried to get a room. They harangued the hotel staff for at least an hour, but there was nothing available short of conjuring a room out of thin air or throwing a bed and a shower into a broom closet. While one of the young ladies at the desk was dealing with Expedia, the other was calling other nearby hotels to see if they had any vacancies. Thankfully, she found one about 6 blocks away. I was able to sink the cost of 2 nights @ $220/night and get reimbursed later, the other lady finally convinced Expedia that there was nothing else they could do, my boss got his reservation money back, and I did the job and got back home.
I wrote a letter the following week to the first hotel thanking both ladies for their help dealing with Expedia's screwup and helping me get a room elsewhere.</td><td>0.7879972063465233</td><td>0.1897569996301364</td><td>9</td></tr>

The article in the 1st paragraph -- quite prominently sets out the exact dichotomy you are talking about, stating:
>And according to our impeachment and removal polling trackers, there isn't broad public support for that either — **just 47 percent of Americans favor removing Trump.**
Also -- That's a leading headline and ongoing constant tracker on 538 -- I think the whole purpose of this poll was to look at the factual belief -- apart from legal/political collusion respondents were making in the "oppose/support"poll.
And I like this poll as it highlights something  quite fascinating to me --- that 52% say he committed impeachable (removable) offenses  - yet in the same poll only 47% supported removal.
That means 5% who think "*Trump's actions regarding Ukraine or his refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry constitute enough evidence to remove him from office*" (52%) but don't support removal (47%).
This 5% is absolute absurd to me --  how can you think the evidence supports removal, and think he should not be removed?</td><td>> The history of female only leagues (from chess to soccer to any other imaginable sport) has always been to give women a 'safe space to compete' because they felt they couldn't keep up in the open circuits. 
You're missing the other important factor in the US at least: Title IX. Passed in the 70s, this law requires roughly equal participation in women's sports compared to men, and is responsible for a drastic increase in scholarships and funding. Some 70,000 women each year get athletic scholarships in sports that make almost no money, largely subsidized by men's revenue sports (football and basketball). These scholarships can be life changing for these women and give huge educational opportunities. 
Protecting women's access to these programs is important, which means they need the ability to compete and win in high school.

[EDITS: spelling and embellishment of the tale, if I'm honest.]</td><td>As I recall, Raspbian saves the current timestamp upon shutdown, then restores the clock from that point during the boot process. ntpdate then picks up the correct time once the network connects. Would it be worth the effort to instead reorder the sequence of services at startup so that your weather station starts after ntpdate syncs the clock? If the weather station software starts recording during the boot process, it could run into uninitialized GPIO and other subsystems, which could render that section of the recorded data useless, regardless of the invalid timestamps.
To be fair, like @doc\_willis I can understand the desire for the RTC add-on for data collectors, but for other uses it's probably unnecessary. However, in an environment where the Pi won't be connected to a network for extended periods of time, RTC could be important, since it wouldn't have the opportunity to sync from an external timebase. IMO, if the device *will* be connected to a network most of the time, RTC probably isn't strictly necessary since you could delay the start of data acquisition until time sync has occurred.
