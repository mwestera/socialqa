50	" This sent me down a little rabbit hole and apparently Japanese, Korean, and Han Chinese people are very genetically similar. The reading I found suggest that the Yayoi people may have traveled from China to the Korean peninsula then through to Japan. Apparently the proto-Koreans were still in manchuria at this time. There are actually several theories still being worked on to explain exactly why Japanese people and Korean people (and Han Chinese) share 99 percent of their genes. I think given that China is included something more nuanced than ""Korea took over/mixed with the Japanese"" is suggested. (I haven't seen anyone suggest that Korea colonized China for example.) Frankly though I'm not 100 percent on my understanding of the layout of the genetic landscape as this was a topic I was ignorant of an hour ago. Regardless I think the phrasing ""Colonize"" is a little spicy given recent history between the two countries. If anyone has some reading to offer please do share as my curiosity has been piqued.

I think that was before his opponents and our institutions had revealed themsevles to be completely corrupt and dishonest. Turns out his taxes were illegally leaked (by said corrupt and dishonest people) anyway, and guess what? Turns out he was hiding nothing. So there goes that theory... It makes much more sense that after his attempts to act in good faith were never reciprocated he came to the realization that he had to fight his opponents rather than try to work with them or cave to their abuse of power (as so many before Trump had done). > kinda how Christians believe Trump to be Christian Unfortunately that argument has no credibility when [these are the types of people](https://nitter.salastil.com/NoVA_Campaigns/status/1744202251046891831) that the liberal media industrial complex shoved down our throats and hailed as our Christian heroes.

278	"> Tucker asked several times why he didn't call Biden to talk it out (Putin effectively responded that he didn't know why he would do that). That's a disingenuous summary and highly misleading. Putin actually said that he wanted a settlement. ""Why would we do that"" refers to the fact that Biden and Ukraine have a hard policy not to negotiate, so ithe onus is on them not Putin. He said he has people in touch with the US administration and they are well aware of Russia's position. So it's up to the Biden admin to respond, not Putin to keep hounding them when their position is literally not to negotiate. Even worse, Putin says he was ready to settle before he went into Ukraine and had reached an agreement that would keep Ukraine intact, but then at the orders of the west Ukraine reneged on it. This was after Zelenskyy ran on accepting the agreement and won the election in Ukraine because of it. So he lied to the voters as well.

Do you believe that your adherence to certain political positions is going to bring about the outcome that you desire, and looking back those who were opposed to your positions are on the wrong side of this outcome? 2.
