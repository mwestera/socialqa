This man was never served notice. The police only showed up once they determined it was time to confiscate. Maryland allows for a District Court Commissioner to enact the ERPO immediately if he/she so chooses, resulting in immediate confiscation of firearms.
Oregon state law only requires the person who requested the petition to attend the hearing, and the hearing is held within 24 hours of the request. No other criminal proceeding exists that may be held without the defendant present with such short notice.
Colorado also does not require the defendant to be present or notified of the hearing, and Colorado requires a same day hearing. Colorado also schedules a second hearing within 7 days, another unreasonably short timeframe for anyone who needs time to prepare themselves with a lawyer and their defense.
California red flag protection orders are ex parte, entirely one-sided and there is no way to contest them for the first 21 days. If you own guns you're hosed because someone can say they feel threatened and you suddenly have to get rid of all of them for nearly a month before you're even allowed your day in court.
So to answer your question, yes the entire point of a red flag law is to deny people due process of law by forcing people to relinquish their firearms before they ever see a courtroom.
> Why wouldn't these cases be handled similarly to a personal restraining order (order of protection), which can also impede one's constitutional rights to assembly or even the ability to stay in one's own home? At those hearings, as far as I know, the person can defend themselves. 
That would be a more logical way of handling it, because standard restraining orders require the accuser to show up in court and require the court to give the accused the opportunity to defend themselves. Red flag laws make no such allowances, and are specifically designed to allow for confiscation of firearms prior to the defendant being notified or given the opportunity to defend themselves.</td><td>Not only is no proof provided, but this doesn't even make sense in the context of school.

That said, Justin Amash, the House's #1 Ron Paul Fanboy, voted *for* a a bill written by Doc Hastings that would forbid all common law (tort) suits against carbon emitters for property damage resulting from climate change, so there's your perfect example of a "libertarian" voting against even basic property rights.

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>SM - School Marm (co-worker who resembles the school teacher from "Little House on the Prairie") This happened a few years back but I still chuckle when I think about it from time to time.</td><td>I also put the opening brace on its own line, unless I'm writing a one-liner if or loop.</td><td>School Marm cannot access internal corporate web site $SM - School Marm (co-worker who resembles the school teacher from "Little House on the Prairie")
This happened a few years back but I still chuckle when I think about it from time to time.
Anyway, my job at the time was maintaining our corporate intranet and extranet.  Users had to enter their email address for their user name and then their password to access the sites.  It seemed like a pretty easy concept except for the School Marm.
This lady was a piece of work.  She truly did act and dress like the school teacher from Little House on the Prairie.  And she could be quite curt especially when it came to technology issues.  Quick side story: she once dropped by and commented on the pictures I have of my kids that sat on my desk.  It was the generic "cute kids" comment but then she followed up with a bit of an insult.  I have a long last name, as do my kids and so she follows up the compliment with "although with that last name, I feel sorry for your kids".  Not the meanest thing anyone has ever said to me but completely unnecessary in my humble opinion (especially since I'd just recently met her).
Back to the story, $SM calls $Me and says she is having issues logging into the intranet.  She swears it's a problem on our end and she is sick and tired of running into problems when logging in.  I apologize and ask her to run me through the error she's receiving.  She huffs and says she enters in her email address and password and immediately gets the error message saying she doesn't have access to the site.  Unfortunately her description wasn't really shedding much light on the situation so I knew I needed some help.
I apologize again and ask her to hold as I needed to contact $Tech.  I message him and he says he's happy to take a look.  So he goes in and sees how she's entering her information and then sends me a laughing face emoji.  I'm like ???.  He says that the School Marm misspelled her own last name when typing in her email address (company protocol was first initial and last name).  She must have misspelled it multiple times too and that's why she was getting the error.  He asks if he can contact her and be the bearer of bad news followed by a devil emoji.  I say "please do but let me get off the phone with her first".
I pick up the phone and tell $SM that $Tech will be contacting her.  She huffs and says "OK" and hangs up.
A few moments later, $Tech messages me with a series of laughing and crying emojis.  He said that $SM immediately changed her tune when he relayed the reason behind the error.  She asked him to apologize to me on her behalf.  I just chuckled.
Anyway, she was able to get into the website after that.</td><td>Nope. I indent with tabs and try to keep the levels consistent. I also put the opening brace on its own line, unless I'm writing a one-liner if or loop.</td><td>-0.0585794409919344</td><td>0.7555810014006423</td><td>0</td></tr>

Obviously the FBI investigation has been well documented but lots of this other stuff was new to me. I clicked on a few of the sources for some of the more salacious allegations and they were either not backed up by the source or much weaker than the article alleges. I have no idea whether Gaetz is the person this article alleges but I do know this is a hit piece.
> In an incident from 2012, Gaetz and some of his legislator bros got drunk at a Disney resort and made a loud scene in the lobby. He attempted to bribe the front desk attendant with $20 to get access to another guest's room.
The ultimate source for this is here. It alleges that Gaetz was one of many who were there but the assertion that he is the one who did this seems to be made up by the Medium author.
> However, in this case the arresting officer was forced to resign in lieu of being fired in an "unrelated" matter within a week of Gaetz's arrest. The judge then quietly dismissed all charges. He somehow even avoided the suspended license. It's good to have a dad who's a leading state senator. 
Those scare quotes around "unrelated" and the last sentence certainly read like Gaetz and his Dad got this officer fired to make a problem go away. What does the actual article cited tell us?
> On Nov. 10, Anglin made a DUI arrest in Destin. An internal affairs report said that Anglin grabbed the suspect around the neck after he believed the suspect spit on him. But three other deputies, including a trainee, were there as well, and said the spitting was unintentional and that Anglin used unreasonable force. An internal affairs report agreed.
> According to Anglin's personnel file, this was his fourth infraction, and third in a year.
Now it certainly seems like Gaetz should have been charged and convicted, but it's hard to do that when the arresting officer has been fired for repeated misconduct.
> They recalled one incident of him making jokes about hiring strippers for a Super Bowl party he organized. 
A joke about strippers? Scandalous!
> Two sources, including a Republican state representative who served alongside Gaetz in the Florida House in 2014–15, have accused Matt Gaetz of coming up with a sex game when he served in the state legislature.
I have no idea whether this is true, but the source of it seems to be a Twitter feud between him and another state legislator where the other guy references a tweet that claims an anonymous source for this. Weak.
> It turned out there was an incomprehensible plot to defraud the Gaetz's out of $25 million...If your head is spinning in disbelief, that's the appropriate response. None of that made a lick of sense. 
You'd think an article published 4 days after the extortionist pleaded guilty to extortion would mention this fact rather than write paragraphs about how far-fetched the plot was. Obviously the Biden DOJ, which accepted the plea and wrote a press release about it, finds the story to make sense despite the author's incredulity. The failure to mention this plea removes any shred of credibility this author might have had. 
> He was a congressman in his late 30s who had never been married or even romantically associated with anyone. I think it's fair to say that many assumed he was gay. After all, being a Republican in an ultra-conservative district, that's the kind of thing you might want to keep quiet. I mean his colorful suits and immaculate hair just screamed closeted homosexual.
Is it actually OK to just assume people are probably gay because they are single, dress well, and have good hair? I've seen the left lob these accusations at others (like Lindsay Graham) and I can't help but feel like this would be considered homophobic if the right did it.
I could go on, but it's tiring to try to fact-check this stuff given the author's twisting. This piece seems to be a collection of truths, half-truths, and rumors built around the one thing we know is true (the FBI investigation) to push a narrative.</td><td>-0.0585703884984945</td><td>0.6955038036327602</td><td>0</td></tr>

2. Use local software to stream and save video feeds. I have my Reolink connected to my Synology NAS and all video is saved to that for the past 7 days. I then use my Home Assistant to view live video while not at home if I need to. Everything is saved locally so no 3rd party has access to my camera.
For option 2 you can even go further to ensure security such as setting up a VLAN just for your camera and block anything on that VLAN from having access to the Internet. This is more advanced setup though.
All this said, I DO NOT have their doorbell camera, just a standard PoE camera on my front porch. The camera has built-in motion detection but that's all. It can't detect if it's a person, animal or car. From my understanding this takes a LOT of processing power thus why they are mostly cloud based systems.

There was a time when people didn't consider digital art to be art, either. Today, many artists use Illustrator, PhotoShop, and other tools to make illustrations and no one bats an eye.

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>Flynn already had accepted a payment from Russian state media in 2015 and failed to declare that just a month later while renewing his security clearance.</td><td>Every policy in every institution in every community in every nation is producing or sustaining either racial inequity or equity between racial groups...</td><td>The timing of these situations is key to informing some of their differences. 
I would speculate that the concern with Flynn was at least *partially* motivated by how early Flynn had been in talks with other countries -- concerns were voiced to the incoming Trump admin almost immediately after Flynn was offered the position. 
Just to make this super clear, the Obama administration voiced their concerns in a private meeting less than 48 hours after the general election. Trump gave a victory speech around 3am on November 9th, 2016, and the meeting in question took place November 10th.
Flynn already had accepted a payment from Russian state media in 2015 and failed to declare that just a month later while renewing his security clearance. 
This would indicate to me (again, this is offering speculation) that the scope of the investigation into Flynn only reached Russia because it already probed his issues in Turkey and was seeking to determine if Flynn had violated the Logan Act at any point between the RT payment and his appointment as National Security Advisor. The phone call that the FBI questioned him about may not have actually been a violation of the Logan Act, and remember, as you said, Flynn's crime wasn't the conversation, it was lying to the FBI about the conversation. 
You mention below that the impetus for the FBI investigation was a violation of the Logan Act, and I don't have time to read through all of the documents. Can you show that the violation they believed he committed was during the phone call specifically , and not some other action related to Russia before his selection as National Security Advisor or even related to his failure to register as a foreign agent for Turkey? Because those things both sound much more likely to have been the impetus for an investigation that at some point would have him questioned over the phone call.
On a less legal note, and strictly one about how comparable these actions are, there's also something to be said for the directly retaliatory nature of the phone call. Flynn spoke to Ambassador Kislyak directly about the Obama presidency's decision to expel Russian diplomats and sanctions **that day**. This was *direct* meddling in the Obama administration -- Flynn was trying to get Russia to not undertake certain activities *during the Obama admin* to help the incoming Trump admin. I can't identify any way in which the Biden admin is trying to get the members of the Iran deal to undertake activities *during the remainder of the Trump admin* to help the incoming Biden admin, or at least I can't in a vacuum, though admittedly details in the reporting are sparse enough that I could obviously be wrong about that. I'm not super sure about this line of reasoning in general though, so I probably won't defend it very aggressively.
This is why in a vacuum, I would say that is the strongest argument for why Flynn's phone call may have been a violation of the Logan Act: it was a negotiation for foreign policy actions ("don't retaliate") negotiated by someone who was not a public official, but would have immediate ramifications while that person still was not a public official. There was an intent to *defeat the measures of the United States.* But in the case of hypothetical Biden talks, there is not an intent to defeat measures, because any changes would happen after Biden was already in office.
That said, I would definitely willing to accept that neither the Flynn phone call nor the rumoured Biden talks are violations of the Logan Act.</td><td>The word "racism" has been completely redefined by the left in the last 5 years. Racism used to have a simple definition: the belief that one race is superior to another, leading to discrimination. Now, it also means something else. The dictionaries have literally been changed. By this definition, **any disparity in outcomes is racist**, even if no explicit bias or discrimination is involved. Conversely, any policy or action that makes outcomes more equal is "anti-racist", even if it is explicitly discriminatory against whites. Further, they state that any person or policy that is not explicitly anti-racist is racist. This is how you end up with people stating things like "only white people can be racist because racism requires power".
One of the most visible proponents of this view is a Boston professor and author named Ibram X Kendi. Here are some excerpts from his bestselling book (source 1, source 2). Apologies for the long quotes, but I want to give appropriate context:
> The opposite of "racist" isn't "not-racist." It is "anti-racist." ... There is no in between safe space of "not racist." The claim of "not racist" neutrality is a mask for racism... The common idea of claiming "color blindness" is akin to the notion of being "not racist"—as with the "not racist," the color-blind individual, by ostensibly failing to see race, fails to see racism and falls into racist passivity. **The language of color blindness—like the language of "not racist"—is a mask to hide racism**...
> A racist policy is any measure that produces or sustains racial inequity between racial groups. An antiracist policy is any measure that produces or sustains racial equity between racial groups. By policy, I mean written and unwritten laws, rules, procedures, processes, regulations, and guidelines that govern people. **There is no such thing as a nonracist or race-neutral policy.** Every policy in every institution in every community in every nation is producing or sustaining either racial inequity or equity between racial groups...
> The defining question is whether the discrimination is creating equity or inequity. If discrimination is creating equity, then it is antiracist. If discrimination is creating inequity, then it is racist. ... **The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination**. The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.
This guy is not some loon. He is widely listened to and these definitions are the basis of how race is taught in corporate diversity trainings and college campuses. The common parlance is now that any inequity of outcomes is oppression and systemic racism. A definition that literally wasn't in the dictionary 5 years ago is now the truth, and questioning it or wanting to be "race-neutral" in your approach to the issue is racist. This is how you end up with policies like states giving preferential vaccine access based on race. MLK's values of "judging people by the content of their character, not the color of their skin" might be considered racist by some today. That's just insane to me.</td><td>-0.0585651733341694</td><td>0.6879949767720471</td><td>0</td></tr>

Lots of people hate gridlock and the duopoly and want a third party. But if you dig deeper, there are many visions of what positions that third party should have. I think for many, "third party" means "party that agrees with me on every issue".

Happened today, while I was wearing normal jeans and a sweatshirt
Was shopping for groceries in my local supermarket, and I was in the crisps aisle.
I'm above average height, so usually when I get asked to do something in the shops it's to grab something off the top shelf for someone, usually an elderly woman.
Today I heard, in a quiet voice, 'Excuse me, could you help me'
I turn around and it's this huge middle aged man, at least 6'5'' tall. I'm quite surprised to hear, but I followed him nonetheless.
He led me through 2 aisles to the cereals section, points down to the aisle closest to the floor, and asks if I could grab 'the red one' as his back was too stiff!
I bent down, grabbed the item and handed it to him, after which he asked me if I was a new employee. I replied no, and he apologised profusely for 'wasting my time'
I told him to think nothing of it, and said my goodbyes.

The internet *must* know your IP address, in order for it to be able to send you the data that you request when you pull up a web page or fetch your email. If the internet *didn't* know your IP address, you won't get any cat videos.
Furthermore, "your" IP address *doesn't belong to you*, plus it changes periodically. It belongs to the ISP that you get your internet service from; they just lease it out to you.
So, what you want to do is use a dynamic DNS service, or DDNS, something like No-IP or Dyn. You'll set up an account with one of those services, pick a domain name, then run a small program on your server which will update that domain name with the IP address currently assigned to your router (it's likely that your router has the capability built into it, so you wouldn't need to install anything anywhere else). Also, forward the ports in your router necessary for them to connect to your Minecraft server.
Now, you just tell your Minecraft friends to connect to your server at myminecraftserver.dynamicdnsservice.tld (don't use that, because it's fake; replace it with your actual dynamic domain name). They can technically still get your IP address, but *that doesn't matter*. And at this point, all they could do with the IP address is exactly what they can do with your DDNS domain name: connect to your Minecraft server, and maybe run a port scan, which at this point would only show the Minecraft server.
BTW, having an IP address *does not* give anyone your exact location. The *best* it can do is show that you use a specific ISP and are located somewhere within a couple hundred square miles of the address on record for that ISP's local office. And for some ISPs, they don't associate IP addresses with specific office locations, so your IP address might locate you to a spot thousands of miles away from your actual geographical location, i.e. the headquarters office of the ISP.</td><td>-0.0585628659217669</td><td>0.7731401933785202</td><td>0</td></tr>

Yesterday, after seeing this story, I attempted to enable end-to-end encryption between the camera and my phone, which would block Ring and law enforcement from seeing the camera live or any recordings.
Ring makes this intentionally hard to find and difficult to do. There are 3 steps buried deep in a menu in the app. Eventually, they generate a 9-word passphrase that's about 50 characters long. They advise storing this in a password manager, but they do not allow copying it to the clipboard (at least from the Android app). Therefore, you have to manually retype 50 characters. I screenshotted it, retyped it elsewhere, and attempted to reproduce it as required, but the app said the phrase was wrong. After checking it about 5 times, I gave up. Hanlon's Razor aside, burying the feature this much and requiring users to manually retype 50 characters instead of allowing the clipboard has to be intentional to discourage the use of this feature.
The steps I tried to follow are here. If others find an easier way to make this work, I'd love to hear it.
Edit: took another crack at this by typing on a PC and was able to get the thing enrolled in E2E encryption. But enabling this turns off basically all of the useful features of being on Ring (motion notifications, video pre-roll, shared links, event timeline, and about a dozen others).

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>Again, possibly some years, but the #1 and #2 seeds were highly likely to be Alabama and Clemson, and the #3 and #4 seed were highly likely to be the Big Ten and Big 12 champs.</td><td>The problem of AI plagiarism is common enough that they could easily give the bot a canned response of you ask it to confirm authorship (something like "I do not remember every response I give and can't reliably answer that").</td><td>If the proposed 12-team playoff rules were in effect in 2018, you can make a strong case that Notre Dame should've just played its scout team against USC. For those who forget, here was the playoff picture going into rivalry week of 2018:
Some relevant notes:
* Alabama, Georgia, Clemson and #24 Pittsburgh had clinched their divisions.
* The winner of OU/WVU would play Texas in the Big 12 championship (I can't remember if Texas had actually clinched at this point, but in any case they would've had to have lost to Kansas).
* The winner of the Apple Cup would play #18 Utah in the Pac-12 championship.
* Michigan/OSU would play #19 Northwestern in the Big Ten championship.
* ND had ranked wins against Michigan, Pittsburgh, Northwestern, and #20 Syracuse. (At this point they were actually #1 in Strength of Record)
In real life, ND was playing to maintain a playoff bid. But what's amusing is if the proposed system was in place then, **there's very little changes in terms of the playoff race if they take a loss**.
In terms of making the playoffs, their ticket is already punched. If they enter the final rankings 12-0, no matter what else happens, they'll get the fifth seed. But if they enter the final rankings 11-1, it's highly likely they'll *still* get the fifth seed. But more importantly, it's nearly impossible to draw up a situation where they finish worse than the #8 seed, maintaining their homefield advantage.
Taking it conference by conference, how would each conference match up to an 11-1 ND?
* **Big Ten:** The loser of OSU/Michigan takes a second loss. The winner either takes a second loss in the championship or clinches a bye. Penn State really doesn't threaten to pass ND.
* **Big 12:** OU winning out would clinch the bye, them losing at some point gets them to two losses. Texas and WVU can't threaten to pass ND.
* **SEC:** The only likely outcome that displaces ND as the 5th seed is that Bama beats Auburn and then loses to Georgia in the championship game. Non-champ Georgia and LSU would have two losses. Florida and Kentucky don't seriously threaten to overtake ND.
* **ACC:** The first thing to keep in mind here is Clemson entered the ACC championship game 28-point favorites, so from the perspective of ND, they can basically count on Clemson taking one of the byes. But the other thing is even *if* Clemson were shocked in championship game, it'd be to a Pittsburgh team ND already beat. Combined with the fact that Clemson also barely beat Syracuse while ND had obliterated them, it's highly likely they would fall behind ND.
* **PAC-12**: Utah and Washington can't jump ND in the rankings. The other likely option that could lose ND the 5th seed is Wazzou winning out and being the obvious fifth man out compared to OU, Bama, Clemson, and OSU/Michigan. But while it's close, my guess is that ND would still be ranked above a one-loss Wazzou given the general weakness of their resume and the general tenor of 
* **American**: UCF was completely disrespected by the committee this season. Even going undefeated, they wouldn't have jumped ND. In real life they didn't even jump 10-2 Michigan.
So from the perspective of ND, there's actually not much to lose in playing your scout team against USC and letting them get obliterated, while giving your starters a two-week bye before the playoffs.
Some objections:
But pride aside, no, they wouldn't. For one thing, there's all sorts of incentive structures built into coaches' salaries that would discourage this. This post is strictly for entertainment purposes. (And yes, to highlight the fact that while the new rules maintain the significance of conference championship game, it does diminish the regular season on occasion.)
***Would Notre Dame players and fans*** **really** ***be okay with throwing a game to USC in particular?*** Idk, I think it would be an amusing amount of disrespect. But there is something to the idea that we don't have to worry about people throwing regular season games because the final game is always rivalry week. But would fans throw a fit if ND tanked down the road against a bad Stanford team, or BYU against some random Mountain West? ehhhhh....
***Don't the advantages of playing the 12th seed make it worth locking in a 5th seed rather than risking a slide?*** In some years, yes, if for example there was a high change that some mediocre G5 conference champion ranked around #24 in the AP would sneak in. But in 2018 it looked like the #12 seed would actually *be* a top 12 team (with UCF set to cruise to a top ten ranking), and there's just not a whole lot of difference between the #11 and #12 teams in the country. But again, the bigger question is not if there's any advantages to playing #12 over #11, but whether the chance of losing that advantage outweighs the guaranteed advantage of taking a bye week. And arguably, you should take the bye week.
***Wouldn't locking in the #5 seed be worth it when it comes to seeding for the quarterfinals, and then the finals?*** Again, possibly some years, but the #1 and #2 seeds were highly likely to be Alabama and Clemson, and the #3 and #4 seed were highly likely to be the Big Ten and Big 12 champs. There was a BIG step from 1-2 to 3-4, but just not a lot of difference between #3 and #4 teams.
***Should ND have done the same in 2012 when they were the #1 team in the country?*** No, because the breakdown of teams was different. An 11-1 Notre Dame that year would've put on equal footing with fellow one-loss non-champs Florida, Oregon, and whoooole bunch of two-loss SEC teams. Given the closeness of their wins in other games, it was by no means certain they'd maintain a homefield advantage.
***Isn't there a chance that ND loses to USC so badly, they slip to #9 or below?*** The committee takes a lot of factors into account when ranking teams, and I'm assuming "every single one of our starters and backups didn't play" would be taken to account.
***Isn't there a chance that the committee gets really pissed at ND tanking and slots them in at #9 as a fuck you?*** Yeah, this is the biggest practical hurdle. I'm operating on the assumption that they approach the matter fairly, but no one would blame them for making an example of ND.
***Any final thoughts?*** Well my biased take is that they should tie the first round byes to rankings. But another possible way to prevent this scenario would be to tie byes to championships, but *homefield advantage* to rankings. So for example, in 2018, a top four ND gets bumped down to #5 seed and plays the #12 seed. But in the next round, when it comes time to play #4 seed (but 6th ranked) Ohio State, the game happens in South Bend.</td><td>IIRC this was not something the professor did, it was something the students did to prove to him that he was making a mistake.

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>With her talks to her attorney, I don't know what's going on and I feel the details are being kept away from me.....</td><td>ALSO, I get my thermostat installed 7/17, so my trans is still running hot.</td><td>How do I handle a commitment when there's an external pressure coming from her and her family? HI everyone, I had seeked approval before posting this because I don't know who else to ask. I have lost my family support so the Reddit community is all I have left for help. I am about to make a major life decision and my gut feeling is saying something else. I don't know if this is confidence issue or a serious warning of life. Any help on my situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
I've been seeing someone for 10 months and we both have set an engagement date to have our marriage legalized and the ceremony (all on the same month). But as the days progress, I am noticing a very pushy behavior from her and family about wanting to legalize, have the ceremony and they are not taking my concerns into my account. They keep saying "you decide what you want." Not only this but I am having to make too many sacrifices to be with her. Not only this, but the commitment dates keep changing from her and family. They are shortening the timeline to get married because of auspicious days. 
Here are the issues that I am facing: 
1. My career is more in IT / government with cybersecurity and hers in automotive. She works in the private sector and I work in the public sector. For me, this is job security with good benefits, and as a manager, she has a stellar reputation at her company (which is her job security). The issue is, my work doesn't exist in her home state and I cannot transfer my job. So that would mean I need to make a big career change (basically a sector transition). And currently, finding a job for me is going to be a big challenge since my interview skills are not the best. And, I already make 6 figures, so going back from public to private sector, I would need to take a significant income cut in order to find another job. (Because mid-level dev jobs are difficult for me to land, considering my experience is elsewhere.). I honestly don't feel comfortable with this. 
2. I have a house with a very good interest rate. She has 2 homes (also with good interest rates). We both have worked hard to get to where we are. She wants me to either I sell my home, or put it on rent. And if I move to her house, she might not add my name to her house. And about the last statement, she said she would do this, and now is reverting back with her statement. So basically, it almost seems as if I am giving up my house for love. 
3. I am currently working on my masters from one of the best universities in the world. If I was to move to her state, and with the significant income cut, I don't think I can afford my education and will be forced to drop. With my current job, I can manage all my living expenses and my education. One plus point is that there are lots of downtime so I can easily make time on my class work. If I change jobs, I am basically giving this up and don't feel comfortable with this.
4. Going back to above points, my parents don't want me to leave my stable job. This job has given me a stable life and I am leaving for an unstable one. The risk here with private sector jobs is that you can be fired at any time, with no warning. They are worried from that point. Even my grandparents don't want me to move or sell my house. They also want me to finish my education and then move out. My GF does not seem to care about all this and keeps saying you decide what you want. I don't feel comfortable by this. 
5. She did request a prenup, which I agreed. And at the moment, she's keeping the details her financial details to herself and not sharing much with me. I have already disclosed all mine in what assets I want to shield (everything prior to marriage). With her talks to her attorney, I don't know what's going on and I feel the details are being kept away from me.....NEW UPDATE on this concern, she did forward me a draft version of prenup from her attorney and she is a lot of assets to shield in case if things go south. I, not as much. She has told me to have it reviewed by my attorney and have it signed, before we legalize our marriage.
6. Last year, when she and I were dating, there were lots of family related issues that took place. My family ended up disrespecting her family (and my GF) and her parents do not approve of my parents. My parents also do not approve either. I fought against my parents approval and tried to convince them to see the good side. It has led to a point where I am not in talking terms with my family (or possibly disowned). My parents think her family is lying / hiding things / or being wishy-washy. The other thing I noticed is that her mother is very dominating and only seem to want things her way (I see this same trait in my GF). Her mother is also very pushy about wanting a commitment, and legalizing the marriage / ceremony. I see this as a sign of concern.  
7. My GF doesn't like it when I talk about my family. It makes me think she might never let me support them even in their old age. Definitely one reason is that she and her family were disrespected by my family. So I can understand her POV on this. I am only concerned if we have children, she might not let them see my parents. I honestly don't feel comfortable with this.
8. GF and her family are not US citizens. In fact, her parents don't even have a status. So once the marriage happens, I would have to begin work for sponsoring her. The 2 concern here are (1) when our families met last year, her mother made a comment "*at least let them legalize the marriage so she can begin her citizenship work.*" (It was something like this). That statement gave off warnings in my head, are they wanting to marry for citizenship or for love? (2) My family asked about their retirement and health (and so did her ex), they don't have an answer. My family seem to be protecting me from all this because living in USA without health insurance in old age is very bad. Plus, their retirement is also a question, as they believe GF's family might not be able to afford and will depend on me and her. My parents can support themselves, but her parents, I don't know. They're not being transparent about this. 
The one good thing is that my GF and I have a great bond. She's taken care of me and so have I. She says I am very loyal, which is exactly what she's looking for. And same with me, I love her as well. Her family is very caring and have supported me as well. They've accepted me for who I am.  
So basically, I am giving up my job, house, maybe masters and even my family at this point for marriage. And also considering the family situation, this is too big of a commitment and I have to make a lot of sacrifices to be with here. I don't know if this is such a good idea and I no longer have my family's support, this also makes things uneasy. I am starting to lose sleep over this and keep thinking I could mess my life up. 
And if I do let her go, I will regret my decision. She's a great woman, and every family has loved her for who she is.
**TL;DR: GF and I love each other and we have a great bond/chemistry. But I am having to make a lot of sacrifice to marry my GF and this includes change in career, leaving a stable govt job and back to private sector, possible drop in masters program, leaving my current city for hers, and leaving my house for hers. I am making very big changes in my life to be with her and all she's doing is moving her parents to a different home (at least they are on their own). Plus, my parents don't approve this relationship because they believe this family is not being transparent. They are not US Citizens so I would have to sponsor GF (her parents might never be able to become citizens because they don't have legal entry). Situation is putting me in a headspin and unsure about all this, GF and her parents are pressuring for marriage ASAP.**
I can't comment but I can provide a response here...
> 10 months of dating and you're planning to get married?
Because her family and GF are pushing the commitment. I agreed to at least 1.5, then she wanted it by 11 months, and this weekend out of nowhere they want it by the end of this month. 
Their justification is that its an auspicious day, which I think is a good religious day. Her father tried hard to push this on me, I told him this was a pressure and he repeatedly said it was not a pressure, its all good day blessing (something like that). 
I told my GF about this and seem very upset with me, she was clear she wants a commitment (i.e. legalization). 
Also, I don't know if it matters but she and her mother recently made me to buy an engagement ring for her despite me repeatedly telling them I don't have much saved for myself (due to my masters). It felt like pressure. They don't seem to care and want things their way.</td><td>Both.  I just got a 2019 1500 limited elevation (so, a 2018 made in 2019) with the 5.3l and 6l80 trans.  I paid 33k, 67k miles.
I am a preventative maintenance nut too, and with these trucks you need to watch for trans and lifter problems (researched) - the best things you can do (to my understanding) without tearing them apart and replacing major components, is to use the OBD2 range chip for full time V8 and to get the GM bulletin trans thermostat installed, which has your trans start cooling at 158F rather than 180F.  GM has acknowledged that 180-190F is a little hot and eventually you will have a torque converter failure.  So this isn't some non-factory mod.
ALSO, I get my thermostat installed 7/17, so my trans is still running hot.  180-190F just driving - towed heavy once for a short distance and it got up to 205, so I won't be towing heavy until I get the new thermostat.</td><td>-0.0585515778087701</td><td>0.6884600920245789</td><td>0</td></tr>

Lots of people hate gridlock and the duopoly and want a third party. But if you dig deeper, there are many visions of what positions that third party should have. I think for many, "third party" means "party that agrees with me on every issue".

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>Right or wrong, they are seen as the ones responsible for the massive surveillance incursion and war expansion immediately post-9/11.</td><td>I refuse to join any club that would have me as a member.</td><td>Long answer:  The Republicans appear to have blown it, at least for now and possibly for the foreseeable future.  I've never seen the pendulum swing this far, and it's concerning.
First, let's begin by pointing out that the first past the post system tends to create a situation where only two parties are politically viable (link one, link two).  It's all well and good that we all want to vote for Gary Johnson (or whoever), but we're at a significant and built in disadvantage against the big two.
So now we have a situation where it's the Democrats vs. the Republicans for all intents and purposes.
I.  Due to a lack of civic education, people fail to see a distinction between what ought to be and what the government ought to do.  Bastiat addressed this in *The Law*:
>'As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all.'
'Socialists' is as SIC in Bastiat, but I think it applies fairly well to the american public and is an argument often made by the political left here.
II.  The democrats have the public school system.  I mean this in more than one way.  Democrats are seen as being pro-education, while republicans are painted as anti-education and anti-intellectual, which is a huge point in the democrats' favor.  
Democrats and their ideals also control the structure and content of schooling to a certain extent.  Public schools are places of centralized control by a government representative, in which all services (healthcare, food, books, and so on) are distributed by the institution.  
Students are heavily surveilled and given few privacy rights, with even bathroom stall doors being removed in more than a few cases (one, two, three).  Students are searched without warrant, and tend in general to have extremely curtailed privacy and property rights.  Students are taught that not only are guns unacceptable, *the idea* of a gun is unacceptable.  (Behold, the pop tart gun suspension, the finger gun suspension, so on and so forth).
Students who make it through high school and progress on to college find themselves in a similar environment.  Colleges structure themselves as a model of an idealized society.  There are only about seven states that permit guns on campus, with guns being banned on campus in the plurality of other states for one reason or another.  College faculty tend to be highly left-leaning, 
The net effect here is an indoctrination effect, in which people are made used to a system where the central authority is the source of services (healthcare, housing, food), there exists little privacy and few private property rights, and firearms and self-defense are unacceptable.
Students educated in this system comprise the majority of the voting public.
III.  Despite how anti-freedom the Democrat platform is, the republicans have somehow managed to make themselves *worse*.  They were in charge of the signing of the original PATRIOT act, they are anti-gay marriage, they remain largely opposed to marijuana legalization, they promote horribly invasive anti-abortion legislation, and of the two parties, they are perceived as being the more pro-war (although I don't know what difference there is any more).  Right or wrong, they are seen as the ones responsible for the massive surveillance incursion and war expansion immediately post-9/11.  The Republicans are also frequently seen as a threat to separation of church and state. 
Despite the fact that the pro-war, anti-marijuana, pro-religion, anti-homosexuality group is a demographic that will only become smaller and less relevant as time goes on, the Republicans continue to double down and lash themselves to the sinking ship of ridiculous socially conservative causes.
What's worse, not only is the republican party socially conservative, under Bush's leadership they were not particularly fiscally conservative, so they don't even have that advantage going for them.
Voters, faced with a choice between a party that is on the wrong side of *every issue* and a party that is on the wrong side of *most* issues are understandably going to choose democrat.  This is doubly true when people fail to understand why the government *shouldn't* be responsible for all social services, *shouldn't* take a more active role in the lives of citizens, or why gun control policy is actually gun consolidation policy (because the government always seems to forget to disarm itself).</td><td>I refuse to join any club that would have me as a member.

You've got it wrong. I let myself get the most fucked in the entire world. 
I got hired on this job January 23rd.   First time I worked it was a short route and he said we get off by 2pm most days . Second day it was 14 hours in the truck . Third it was 15. Then 12 then 13 then 19 then 12 then 13. So many fucking hours . For a flat rate of $140 a day. 5 days a week 700. For 60-80 hours a week .  Delivering heavy ass fridges and shit up and down stairs.  Two weeks after I was hired I got $700 zelled to me after my boss said my w-4  wasn't set up yet . Then one week later, yesterday  , I don't go to work cuz I went to sleep at 3:30  and alarm was set for 5. So I'm like welp guess I quit today cuz that's usually what no shows are .  I was supposed to have today  off but cuz of today my boss texted me I have to work tmmr. So I said I'm  going to a job interview, I'm quitting ,  and that it's mostly because of the long hours. He  then explains that because  the dolly was left in  the laundry room next to the driver installing the washer, I have to pay for it. And because a driver I was with crashed into a guard shack, I am responsible as well for that . And because a lady claims we scratched her door with a fridge we installed , also responsible to pay for that . And the big one is he says that because I didn't come to work , and he had to cancel the truck , he says the company he gets the contract from charges him $1000,   So he will charge me $1000. So I am not getting paid for the last two weeks of hell I've suffered . I was a good employee and tried my best.

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>In addition, you must obtain a  formal statement from the government of these countries that Israeli aid  was not responsible for the production or development of any goods and  services supplied to the organization.</td><td>Once the game starts, you can hover over "bob's deck" (where your opponent's deck would be in a normal Hearthstone game) and see it also.</td><td>Everything every BDS-hole should boycott but never will So your  organization has decided to boycott all products and services from  Israel. Here is a list of activities that you now need to perform in  order to comply with this boycott.
First,  remove all Intel Pentium and Celeron computer processor chips from  personal computers (desktops, laptops and notebooks) as these were  either developed or manufactured in Israel.
Note that the  revolutionary new Ivy Bridge processor will be manufactured in  Israel. Any computers running the Windows XT operating system must be  turned off immediately as this was developed in Israel. All current  Microsoft operating systems are not to be used as Microsoft is heavily  reliant on its Israel R&D centre.
**Step 2**.  Any computers that still work need to have their anti-virus software  and personal firewalls removed as this technology originated in Israel.  The organisation's firewall will also need to be switched off. Staff  should no longer open external emails as most of these will be infected  with viruses. No outgoing emails can be sent. The algorithm (code)  that's used today for sending e-mails, was made by an Israeli who worked  at the Ben-Gurion University in Be'er-Sheva in 1980.
**Step 3**.  Discard all mobile phones, as this technology was developed in Israel,  where the first mobile phones were manufactured. Mobile chip technology  from a single Israeli company has now been installed in over 100 million  devices. Only top-level staff may retain mobile phones for emergency  situations. However the use of SMS (Texting) is expressly forbidden as  this facility was developed in Israel. No 4G devices can be used, as the  chipset is Israeli.
**Step 4**. Turn off  your voice-mail service and delete any recorded messages. Israeli  companies invented the voice-mail system. If someone you do not know  answers your phone-call, then hang up. Israeli call-centres and  call-centre technology is in widespread operation in the UK.
**Step 5**.  Before accepting any printed material, check that the supplier has not  used the Israeli device that might have saved up to 50% of the ink used.
**Step 6**.  At home, do not use Facebook as many in-built and add-on applications  are Israeli-developed. Do not watch videos on the Internet as the  platform used to upload them may be from AOL and hence from an Israeli  company. Do not use the Internet to search for answers to your questions  as this may involve use of an Israeli-developed search engine. Better  to remain unenlightened.
**Step 7**. On your  TV or home entertainment centre, do not use Video On Demand (VOD) to  watch movies as you may inadvertently see an advert displayed  using Israeli software. Do not purchase any games devices as these are  likely to use Israeli technology.
**Step 8**.  Do not read books using an e-book as this may contain Israeli  technology. Do not use data storage as it may have been developed at  Israel's storage technology R&D center.
**Step 9**.  Do not buy an electric car as it is likely to be powered with  an Israeli battery or use Israeli developed charging mats. Continue to  sit in traffic knowing that you are polluting the environment and  financing oil-rich despotic regimes.
Turning to  food and drink, all food outlets on the organisation's premises must  dispose of cherry tomatoes, which were developed in Israel. Staff must  ensure that no cherry tomatoes are included in sandwiches brought into  office premises. The ban also applies to honey and any products derived  from honey. Israel has developed solutions to the worldwide problem of  bee-colony collapse, so that any products derived from bees might only  be available now due to an Israeli invention.
Avoid  drinking any of the world-recognized award-winning Israeli wines. Do not  consume homemade drinks from Israeli-manufactured household drinks  machines.
Avoid any fruit from South Africa or Peru as produce from these countries is being marketed with Israeli brand names.
No  agricultural products from the following areas must be consumed as they  use water irrigation and agricultural technology provided directly from  Israel. This includes most of Africa, China, India, Indonesia (a Muslim  country), Nepal and many others.
Much fruit and  vegetables (including organic) imported into the UK has been enhanced  using Israeli technology. This may save millions of people from starving  around the world, but is not a good reason for you to eat it. To be  safe, only eat fruit and vegetables that you have grown yourself using  seeds that have been in your family for generations.
Destroy  all personal medication. Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals, the largest  generic drugs company in the world, will have manufactured many of your  medicines.  Staff with the following illnesses will need to take  specific precautions.
Cancer – do not take any form of  medication or treatment. Israeli scientists have been working at the  forefront of oncology for decades.
AIDS and HIV – beware;  researchers at Israel's Weizmann Institute or Hebrew University  developed or improved AZT and Hypericin-based drugs; they have also  developed a treatment that destroys HIV-infected cells without damaging  healthy ones.
Diabetes – do not measure or inject Insulin using the devices developed by Israeli scientists.
Multiple  Sclerosis – stop taking Copaxone, one of the most efficient medicines  and the only non-interferon agent, as Teva developed it.  Don't  touch Laquinimod either.
Parkinson's – remove the  Israel-pioneered brain pacemaker to stop tremors. Discontinue Levodopa,  which reduces motor disturbances. Cease sessions that involve magnetic  cortex stimulation.
Staff with a family history of heart  disease and arteriosclerosis must not use the Israeli device for early  detection of these.  Rather, wait until onset of the disease.
Epileptics  – stop treatment that may have benefited from the Israeli discovery of  the underlying mutant gene; also throw away the bracelet that sends out  an alert when a person goes into seizure.
Staff or relatives with Age-related Macular Degeneration – remove Israeli implants that arrest the disease.
Liver disease – abandon Israeli-developed antibody immunotherapy treatments.
Emphysema – steer clear of the Israeli protein replacement therapy.
Myeloma – stop taking the drug Velcade, which was developed over a period of 30 years by scientists at Haifa.
Sleep apnea – no tests using the breakthrough Israeli device for diagnosis.
Dyslexics must not benefit from the Israeli Internet-based reading system.
Skin allergies must be treated with steroid creams only, as the new safer non-steroid alternative is Israeli.
Any  incident of stroke or head trauma or onset of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,  MS, epilepsy, glaucoma or brain tumor must avoid using any of the  Weizmann Institute's patented methods of treatment.
Before  any surgery or medical tests, check that hospital catheters have not  been protected from infection using the new plastic from Israel that  disables microorganisms. Avoid throat surgery as this may utilize  Israeli surgical lasers.
Ensure any colonoscopy or gastro  investigation does not use internal Israeli cameras such as the  Pillcam.  Never undergo surgery to install an artificial heart, as the  first artificial heart transplant took place in Israel.
Kidney  transplant patients must wait for donors of the same blood group as  only Israel's revolutionary new methods allow donors from other blood  groups.  Staff of Arab origin must not make use of the only database for  matching potential Arab donors of bone-marrow – in Israel.
In  the event of a spinal injury or disease, do not accept spinal  implants – likely to be an Israeli product or development. Heart rhythm  problems must not be solved with the Israeli-developed heart pulse  generator. All heart stents are off-limits as most of these originate  from Israeli medical companies.
Check all vaccines as many  of these have been developed in Israel.  Ensure that all X-rays do  carry a radiation risk, as the only radiation-free system is  Israeli.  Treatments derived from Stem Cell research must be avoided  as most of these are Israeli-developed.
If you or your  family are struck with a bacterial infection, do not take alternatives  to older, ineffective bacteria-resistant antibiotics, as an  Israeli discovery will have been responsible for the modern, effective  drugs. Check that any pain relief medication is not based on soya as an  Israeli doctor discovered the beneficial effect of the soya bean.
Do  not use the revolutionary new Israeli bandage that saved the life of  Arizona senator Gabriella Giffords after she was shot in the head.  If  you break a bone badly, reject any treatment that involves introducing  collagen, as this may have been manufactured from Israeli plants.
Do not protect babies and infants from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome with the Babysense system from Israel.
Do not use Epilady (or epilator) – two Israelis invented this hair removal device.
Finally, reject all major dental treatment, as your teeth may need to be scanned with an Israeli-developed dental scanner.
When  interviewing prospective new staff or holding meetings with members of  the public or with individuals from other companies, it is vital that  you check whether they originate from, or are associated with the  following countries and areas. You must ensure that you do not have any  contact with people who have benefited from Israel's aid to those  countries. The organization must avoid any possible acknowledgment of  Israel's contribution to world relief.   In addition, you must obtain a  formal statement from the government of these countries that Israeli aid  was not responsible for the production or development of any goods and  services supplied to the organization.

Pakistan (2005) and Peru (2007) both accepted aid from Israeli NGOs following earthquake disasters.
Peru's hydro-electric power plants are also being built and run by an Israeli company.
Rawanda, Mexico, Chad,  Sudan (Darfur) and Malawi all have received humanitarian aid from  Israel, including medical assistance from Israel's NGO IsraAID.
Always  remember that the boycott extends to any individuals from the above  regions that have been exposed to Israeli assistance during the 63 years  existence of the current Jewish State.
\-Reject  all products from the USA. Analysis conducted in a typical US  stateshows that Israeli innovations were responsible for $2.4 billion in  direct revenue to that state's economy in 2009 and generated nearly  6,000 jobs.
\-Do not tutor your children in advanced  Mathematics techniques, which may have originated in Israel. Also, if  these techniques are used in your children's schools, withdraw your  children immediately.
\-Keen ornithologists should consider  giving up their hobby as many rarespecies stop off or reside in Israel  during their twice-yearly migration.
\-Do not watch the new series of NCIS as one of the actresses is Israeli.
\-Avoid going to any football matches featuring teams with Israeli players.
\-Destroy  all your recordings of Madonna, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Deep  Purple, Bon Jovie, Justin Bieber, George Benson, Moby and many, many  more artists who have ridiculed the illogical boycott and have proudly  performed (or will shortly perform) concerts in Israel.
\-Destroy  any recordings of U2, Lady Gaga, Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, Beck,  Rihanna Coldplay and any artist whose music has been recorded using  the sound technology of the Grammy Award winning Israeli company Wave  Audio. You also must get rid of any personal copies of *Shrek*,*American Beauty* and *Star Wars*. Do not trust anything recorded by Sony, JVC, Toshiba or Dell.
\-Don't go to see *The Black Swan* with Natalie Portman, or watch any old films with Elizabeth Taylor – both lovers of the Jewish State.
\-Do not stay in hotels or visit shopping centers owned by Israeli companies (sorry, you will need to check which ones yourself).
\-Do not have anything to do with the banks who are using Israeli software to prevent fraud.
\-Do  not use any credit or debit card as the Security monitoring system used  by the credit card companies is likely to be Israeli.
\-Do not buy an engagement ring containing a diamond as it is possible that this may have been cut in Israel.
\-Do not travel by air, as your plane might get towed by the Israeli-built "Taxibot."
\-Do not use public transport inside Amsterdam, Moscow or Northern Chinain case you benefit from Israeli transportation devices.
\-If  you suffer a power or network failure, be grateful that at least you  haven't installed the Israeli system that prevents power outages.
\-Finally,  you need to leave all your taps running when you leave home and must  never flush your  toilet, because Israel provides water-saving technology to over half of  the planet. It also is providing sewage treatment technology across the  world, including to the UK. It should be obvious by now that all the  measures specified in Parts 1 – 4 of this series of blogs will  inevitably mean that your organization and your staff will be completely  unable to function.  Let's therefore hope that the decision by your  organization to boycott Israeli products is flushed down the toilet of  history.

I keep on seeing designs/intros where they say there is no leaf to leaf connectivity.
What I am trying to understand is, how do they then achieve redundancy on server?
My ESXis have 4 network ports.

Then the next step would be to create a vPC.

I assume that the larger box may have had a DVD as the $10 one did not have one. Anyway the PP is nice and I have to say that it makes doing an Atomic Pushup all the harder. Well worth the $10. Go check it out.</td><td>-0.25434633330659</td><td>0.691287882948892</td><td>0</td></tr>

Basically I am supposed to train this girl on *my job.* I'm willing do that because I barely want this contract anymore and really don't care for it because of the crap I've had to put up with to retain it. This type of thing happens with this client *all the time*. I've been in this business for ten years and my complaints can be counted on one hand, and we have over seventy Google reviews, all 4 and 5-star ratings, many of them mentioning me by name. Then this client comes along. This was just kind of the last straw after three years.

>**X:** Will she be ready and through the training in the next hour and a half?  
>**X:** **Q**, I have to say I'm a little annoyed. **\[NEW EMPLOYEE\]** reports that you had another client during her training time, then you had network issues and were going to call her back, then never called her back. So now she's not trained for our meeting today so now my time is going to be wasted.  
>**Q:** I did have a client this morning and when it started to run long I let her know that it was running long and I would be a little delayed. I come into the office and **\[NET PROVIDER\]** is working on the lines right now which pretty much eliminates anything involving remote work. I had asked her for her phone number so that way I could call her Direct, but **\[NET PROVIDER\]** who is also my cell phone company, wasn't allowing access to 4G and I did not get the phone number until right about an hour ago.

Had a used car dealership with a location in Fairbanks and another in Anchorage, and they wanted to buy websites from us, one per location. An important part of the website was getting the dealer's inventory on the site, including photos of the cars, VIN, features, options, yadda yadda.
Most customers could just send us a CSV export directly from their dealer management system, sometimes tab- or pipe-separated (and occasionally XML, ugh, I hated those) -- no problem, I had loads of existing code to deal with all of that, automated, as long as the export arrived by the time the import ran, Bob's your uncle.
This pair of dealers, however, ran an ADP system, which consisted of some sort of minicomputer running at each location, with a web interface which simply stuck a terminal emulator into a web page, green text and all. But they could export their data as a text file, so they sent it to me to look at.
This was not CSV. It was not tab-separated. It was not pipe-separated. Hell, it wasn't even XML. It was simply grouped lines of text, with control characters embedded (sprinkled about the file liberally). Each group had the same type of information, but it wasn't consistent -- the lines of information were not in the same order from record to record, the installed options were not in any sort of cohesive pattern and didn't consistently use common terms for features, and you might not even get the same number of lines in each record. There were significant issues with this file structure.
So we contacted ADP to see about getting a nice CSV export set up from the dealers. There was already an Excel file export on the web terminal page, so we figured a CSV export would be quick and easy, maybe even a feature that already existed and simply needed turned on.
ADP wanted to charge us fifty thousand dollars for them to write the CSV export.
The final import script I wrote simply extracted the VIN, mileage, and sale price from each record, and hit up our VIN lookup system for the rest.</td><td>-0.2483647466021961</td><td>0.7525093700622558</td><td>0</td></tr>

The author eventually clarifies that his envisioned "civil war" will not be a bloody battle, but his view of the stakes is still quite clear.
> The civil war I see is not the kind that would leave hundreds of thousands of young men dead in combat. That is not to say that we aren't seeing spats of violence but rather that this new war will be fought in courts, statehouses and ballot boxes, rather than in the fields.
And this war won't be only about the subjugation of Black people but also about the subjugation of all who challenge the white racist patriarchy.
I found this passage interesting as well:
> Can they make the case that all that the Constitution has not explicitly spelled out should be reserved for the states?
The author has pasted almost verbatim the 10th amendment and implies that the states are being novel or harmful in their belief that it exists.
Overall, I find this piece horribly distasteful and divisive. The author wants the NYT's liberal base to believe that conservatives take their inspiration from slaveholders and want to "subjugate" them. From a group that claims to deplore violent rhetoric, declaring war on the other side (or claiming the other side will wage war against you) seems unhelpful to the level of discourse.</td><td>-0.2474705750728749</td><td>0.6962159335806637</td><td>0</td></tr>

Red flag laws ignore the due process of law by their very nature. With nothing more than a phone call from , you are deprived of your property and your 2nd amendment constitutional rights, which could be argued by some to be an aspect of your liberty.
Due process means that you are allowed to face your accuser in court and plead your case to defend yourself. ERPO hearings are usually held without the accused even being notified, much less allowed to present a defense or cross-examine the person accusing you.
Furthermore, it does not need to be proven you have committed a crime to deprive you of your property. The only requirement is that someone else believes you might commit a crime - harming yourself or others. This opens the door to other similar laws, where you could have your computer confiscated if someone believes you might start cyber bullying or spreading false news for example. It's impossible for the punishment to ***NOT*** be cruel and unusual when no crime has been committed in the first place.
Ignoring the gun debate entirely, red flag laws still set a dangerous precedent that people can be "convicted" and punished while never being arrested, never knowing the charges against them until it's already decided, and never setting foot in a court of law to defend themselves.

Several years ago I worked as desktop support for a hospital system.  I got my job because this system had just purchased a small community hospital in the middle of nowhere and they only had one IT guy to begin with, so I came in as backup so to speak.  Some years prior the community hospital had contracted with another local doctor to set up a cancer treatment center.  Again, small community in the middle of nowhere.  The treatment center was kind of a joke, but it did exist.  The contract was about as poorly written as it gets.  The hospital gave him the building and paid for the initial equipment, he maintained 51% of the business.  He also did his own IT work and the hospital "would provide computer support as needed".  That was the actual clause in the contract, so often times we would get called for things we had no business touching and it would start a fight because I didn't know how to work on a spectrometer.  One day I get a call, and it goes a little something like this:
$doc = "Doctor who knows just enough to be dangerous"
$doc:  "Hey!  So...Windows XP is going out of support.  I bought all new SSDs, flashed the new Windows onto them, and replaced all the hard drives in my building at once without testing, and now I have a machine that doesn't work.  Come fix it!"
The problem was that he had a piece of diagnostic software that would no longer work properly post-upgrade.  All kinds of weird things going wrong with it.  Doctor just says "It won't work".  I called vendor support and, after about ten minutes of this guy getting more and more confused that I don't have the buttons and fields I should have, he asks for the version.
$me:  "Well, doc, I'm sorry, but I can't help you.  If I was able to both A) Understand medical diagnostics at that level and B) Completely rewrite the source code of a medical diagnostic application and make it work properly and securely, I sure wouldn't be working here.  You gotta upgrade."
$doc:  "Hey!  I think I found a way to fix that software!  But now I can't get out to the internet.  I need you to come fix it"
$doc:  "So...the problem was that it wouldn't run properly on the new windows, so I installed virtual box on the machine and put Windows XP on the vm, and installed the software there.  It launches properly now!  Unfortunately the license for the software is tied to the mac address of the computer, so I had to change the mac address of the vm to match the license so I could get it to launch, but now it can't get out to the internet.  I need you to fix it."
I didn't even respond.  I just gave him a deadpan stare and then walked away.  Last I knew he left the new Windows SSD in and swapped out to the old hard drive when he needed to use the software.  Shortly before I left the organization they had forced him out for various hippa violations and completely reworked the office into a proper facility.

I know everything I've said is anecdotal, but I also happen to think this is a pretty big deal.</td><td>The ancient Greeks are known for their marble sculptures, which are often seen as white and unadorned in today's museums. However, historically, these statues were vividly painted in a practice known as "polychromy" (from Greek, meaning "many colors"). Here's a breakdown of how the Greeks approached the painting of their marble statues:
   - Once a sculpture was carved, the surface would be prepared for painting. This could include smoothing the marble and possibly applying a primer to help the paint adhere better.
   - The Greeks employed a variety of pigments derived from natural materials such as minerals and plants. Common pigments included ochre for red and yellow, malachite for green, azurite for blue, and charcoal or bone black for black. They might have also used expensive imported pigments.
   - The painting would be done meticulously, often with fine brushes to achieve detailed patterns and designs. They used techniques like shading and highlighting to create a more lifelike appearance.
   - In some cases, gilding (the application of gold leaf or gold paint) was used to add further adornment to the statues, indicating jewelry or divine attributes.
   - A varnish or protective coating might be applied to help preserve the paint and provide a sheen to the surface.
   - Over centuries, the paint on the marble sculptures weathered away, often due to exposure to the elements and the passage of time, leaving behind the white marble we see today.
   - Recent technological advancements like UV fluorescence and spectrometry have allowed archaeologists to detect traces of paint on ancient sculptures, providing insight into the polychromatic practices of the Greeks. These discoveries have led to a reevaluation of ancient Greek (and Roman) aesthetics and a better understanding of their artistic practices.
   - Modern recreations of painted ancient sculptures have been created to give a sense of what these artworks would have looked like in their original, polychromatic state. These recreations challenge the long-held perception of white, pristine Greek marble statues and reveal a much more vibrant and colorful aesthetic in ancient Greek art.
The practice of polychromy reflects a rich tradition of artistic expression in ancient Greece, demonstrating a level of sophistication and appreciation for color that is often overlooked when viewing the white marble remains of their iconic sculptures.</td><td>-0.0176889375731006</td><td>0.7707106140234563</td><td>1</td></tr>

* Top level comments must be the spoiler formatted description of a card revealed today. Any other top level comment will be removed. All discussion relating to these cards shall take place as a response to each top level comment.
* Discuss the revealed cards and their potential implications in competitive play. Karma grab or off-topic comments, as well as discussion about non-competitive Hearthstone should be reported/removed for discussion to be visible.
For those of you looking to catch up, here's the previous card discussion.
**Card text:** Your cards that summon minions summon twice as many.
* **Turncoat Contract:** Destroy a minion. It deals its damage to adjacent minions.
* New wording for Burgle effects - prevents the Thief Rogue mirror from being a feel-bad moment for either side. While previous Burgle cards will retain their original wording and functionality, future Burgle cards will use this new wording and yield non-Rogue class cards only.
**Card text:** After your hero attacks, shuffle a Bomb into your opponent's deck.
**Card text: Battlecry:** Shuffle a Bomb into your opponent's deck. When drawn, it explodes for 5 damage.
* Bomb Token
* As stated by Whalen on stream, this is the only neutral **Lackey** generator in the set.
#New Set Information
* Reveal Schedule
* **New Keyword - Twinspell:** When you cast a spell with Twinspell, it adds another copy of itself to your hand (but this time without Twinspell). So you can cast them twice in total. Unlike **Echo**, they don't have to be played during the same turn. 
* **New Mechanic – Schemes:** Scheme cards are spells that start off weak and grow stronger each turn they're in your hand, increasing a number on them each turn.
* **New Token Cards – Lackeys:** Because every evil mastermind needs a lackey! Lackeys are new Token cards. You can't put them into your decks, they are only generated by other *Rise of Shadows* cards. There are five Lackeys in total, one related to each of the villains. They are all 1 mana 1/1 minions with helpful **Battlecries**. As more villains join the League of EVIL throughout the year, more Lackeys will become available!
* **Callback Cards:** All of our villains have been around for quite a while, so some of the new cards might be familiar. Callback cards will be using mechanics from past expansions.

Hmm, why did the BBC only tell me they were being asked to pay rent, but not that it's a tiny fraction of market price and won't increase for decades?
> The four Sheikh Jarrah homes in dispute were built on land owned by Jews before the 1948 Israeli War of Independence, when they were seized by Jordan and leased to Palestinian families. 
Again, the damn BBC mentioned what the Palestinian position on the property was, but not this.

Yesterday I got onto a subway train around rush hour so it was quite packed. I squeeze in with my brother and find a spot to stand. I notice a little dude (about 6 or 7) in the seat next to where I'm standing squish up against his mother to make room for me. He looks up and smiles, his eyes inviting me to sit down next to him. As a larger human, 6'3" almost 200 lbs, the tiny half a seat that he had opened up wouldn't quite fit me.
Though I couldn't let his kindness go unnoticed so I decided to half-cheek it, to be sure he understood what he did was really nice. As I sat down I thanked him for making room and told him I really appreciated the gesture. We high-fived and in hindsight I should have ended it there.
I noticed he had his backpack with him so I asked how school was that day. He told me it was just alright. Then I asked the fatal question, "Do you have a lot of homework over the weekend?" He let me, the stranger, know he had a big math packet that he had to get done. Unfortunately for him, his mother was listening to our conversation.
Her eyes lit up when he told me about the packet. She yelled "Oooo boy!! You told me you finished that yesterday! Guess who doesn't get to play his video games this weekend?! You, ya little liar!!!" His head sunk into his chest, as did mine right along with him. 
A few stops later his mom dragged him off the train by his little jacket. He looked back at me as they departed, a look that said "bro, I thought we were cool, how could you do me like that???" His look of betrayal is gonna haunt me for days. 
Hang in there little buddy! One weekend may seem like an eternity at your age, but time flies! 
TL;DR- Sat down next to a little dude on the subway because he went out of his way to make room for me. Asked him about homework and now he cant play his video games for the whole weekend.</td><td>Honestly, I'm not sure. I had to leave due to a family emergency.

The recording shows completely the opposite - he respected the sensitivity of the info and was protective of it. There is no evidence he did anything other than wave a piece of paper in front of them (of which I am sure they can recite no details), and by some accounts the paper was a news article and NOT the document he was talking about in the tape (which he did not have).
But here's the kicker. EVEN IF we give you the benefit of the doubt after years of lying about context to smear president Trump, he only revealed what GENERAL MILLEY had already illegally leaked to the media - that there was a plan to attack Iran.
So why was Milley not prosecuted when he was the one who made public this super secret information that YOU YOURSELF claim to be so concerned about? As you said, how can you vote for the people who play it so loose with classified information??? Why do you vote for the people who went after Trump here but not Milley, who leaked this classified info?
I suspect you cannot respond to these points because they completely debunk you. They blow your entire world view here out of the water and prove you're without a doubt the one who is wrong.
> This rebuts everything he stood for against Hillary
1) Hillary was not the president and did not have the authority to decide classification status.
2) Hillary's server was totally insecure and likely hacked, giving valuable information to the enemy. Every single document even MARKED classified was found either in Trump's dedicated storage fascility or his office according to the indictment itself (all the pictures of boxes in bathrooms and on the stage were FAKE as none contained any documents that were marked classified). Maralago served as the second white house during Trump's term and is protected by secret service. It is incredibly secure and not in any way comparable to how Clinton handled classified material.
3) Hillary kept the private server to run under the table deals and hide the information from the public and dodge FOIA requests. When the public came after her she could completely delete all the evidence and corresponsence that the public has a legal right to oversee. And ultimately that is exactly what she did, even going so far as to wipe and smash her hard drives that were UNDER SUBPEONA which is blatant obstruction of justice.
On top of these three things which are 1000x more egregious than anything you accuse Trump of, Trump was charged and Hillary was not (we were told "no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case").
So even on your second point you are so badly wrong as well.</td><td>Physical things that were not there when I confronted them. 
Example: I was a canine officer, I saw a man sitting on a park bench at 1am. He would respond then would not obey commands then reached for his jacket pocket like he was pulling a gun. I went dog loose and my K-9 looked at me like I was crazy. When I looked back at the park bench there was nothing there. A search of the area turned up no results. 
One time I was parked behind an old courthouse early in the morning. I was looking down at some paperwork and the corner of my eye I saw a man in local prison smocks walking up to me. When I looked up he was still walking to me. Then I did a double take and he was running at me as if to attack. Then my brain realized this must be a prison escapee and he's charging my car. I jump out pistol drawn and order him to the ground. Before I could complete my sentence I there was nobody there. Vanished in thin air. I called every prison in the state and there was no missing inmates.
I've chased shadows of beasts that don't exist and I've seen 10ft tall thin man walk out of the woods.

I was rolling out about four cases of something for a fully empty shelf. As i am getting into the task, i hear one old man (M1) greet another old man (M2) who has been wandering around the snack aisle but has nothing in his hands, no basket etc. My coworker and I had been dodging M2 for at least ten minutes while trying to stock the section. 
So i hear behind me the following conversation:
(At this, i figure they know each other and that it is a normal convo)
M1: I can't find the chips I like, it looks like they are out, I can't remember the brand name. 
I turn a bit to see what is happening in this silence. M1 is gesturing to the empty shelves we are working on restocking, M2 looks deeply confused. 
(I have turned away at this point so they won't be able to see that i am struggling not to burst out laughing)
M1: OH! I thought you— i heard you talking— it sounded like you were instructing— uh, sorry. 
So at this point, i am ready and expecting to receive the question next, as I am wearing multiple pieces of company-issued and brand-emblazoned clothing. 
M1 walks past me, walks past my coworker who is knelt down ACTIVELY stocking the shelves (she is obv also labeled front and back as a store employee) and heads DIRECTLY out of the store. I was finally free to burst into laughter. 
(before anyone asks why i didn't jump in with an offer of help, it is because i am a good NPC and i only interact if directly addressed. This is what two decades of retail work will do to you.)</td><td>Your mom is a JN, big-time. As others in the comments have said, mom isn't a "soft place to land", she's a concrete pit with metal spikes -- *stay away*. Your husband is trying to protect his new family from one who clearly wants to cause damage to it, if not outright destruction (i.e. your mother). You and hubby are a team now -- stick together no matter what she tries to do. Your husband is revealing his shiny spine and is trying to do his job to protect you from JNMom's machinations -- put on your sunglasses and hang on, cuz it's going to be a helluva ride.
> I feel like she's saying "I know you're going to get divorced one day, but don't worry, I'll be here for you when that happens."
That's *exactly* what she's saying, and even hoping for. Worst case, *she'll try to bring that prophecy to fulfillment* through her manipulations, just to maintain her control over you. She will try to pit you against hubby; *do not fall into the trap*. You say you don't want to rock the boat. It's understandable, but you *need* to flip that boat over and *throw her out of it*. Do everything you and hubby can to get out of her house and into your own place as quickly as possible. You're freaking out and mad at hubby, even though you agree in principle with what he said.  That's what *she* wants, though -- you angry at *him* instead of *her* over what *she* did wrong. *That's the trap*. Let your anger at him subside, because he did what was necessary at the moment. Your husband is not the enemy here; he's your greatest ally. I think you know that, but years of indoctrination from the *real* enemy have you reacting knee-jerk. Suppress the brainwashing and look at it rationally.
Set those boundaries, set clear penalties, and *stick to them*. If you have trouble doing it, let your husband run interference -- it seems like he's already getting into the battle here, and I think he's up to the task. Until you're strong enough to get all the way out of the FOG, let him be the bad guy (as far as mom is concerned), but don't let him do it alone; *stick with him* -- he's going to need your support. Don't let your mom tear the two of you apart.
> EDIT: I did confront her after the rent thing to let her know I thought we had agreed on just utilities, and she did back down, but it was in that moment we realized some weird dynamics were at play.
Excellent! You stood to her up in a relatively simple matter, and *you won*. Let that build some confidence in yourself. You also begin to see how things are going to start playing out, so be prepared for bigger and harder battles. Take it one battle at a time, one day at a time, and let hubby help -- that's one of the things we husbands are there for in our marriages. Don't get complacent -- get ready for the next encounter.
I'll echo what others have already said -- get some counseling to help you clear the FOG. And above all else, *talk with your husband*. He is there for you, just as much as you are there for him. He seems to have the strength you need right now to get clear -- use it, and eventually you will have your own strength and the confidence to use it.
I know that science-fiction is not everyone's cup of tea, and especially not Star Trek. But there's an episode of Deep Space Nine that I think is worth a watch (season 6, episode 7, "You Are Cordially Invited") -- Worf and Jadzia's wedding ceremony in the last few minutes of the episode. I think it shows a picture of what you and your new husband need to be in your current situation -- a united force fighting against all who would destroy you (i.e. your mother and any flying monkeys she sends your way), watching each other's backs, and picking each other up when something knocks you or hubby down. This *will* be a battle, and you need to be ready to fight it. You have already noticed the problems, and you agree with what hubby wrote. You just need the confidence in both him and the two of you together, and the strength to break through a lifetime of mom's programming.</td><td>-0.0176764607514532</td><td>0.6711660337560852</td><td>1</td></tr>

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>I've never seen the pendulum swing this far, and it's concerning.</td><td>I am looking for a few beta testers to test out the chatbot in exchange for a free will and access to digital storage for a year.</td><td>Long answer:  The Republicans appear to have blown it, at least for now and possibly for the foreseeable future.  I've never seen the pendulum swing this far, and it's concerning.
First, let's begin by pointing out that the first past the post system tends to create a situation where only two parties are politically viable (link one, link two).  It's all well and good that we all want to vote for Gary Johnson (or whoever), but we're at a significant and built in disadvantage against the big two.
So now we have a situation where it's the Democrats vs. the Republicans for all intents and purposes.
I.  Due to a lack of civic education, people fail to see a distinction between what ought to be and what the government ought to do.  Bastiat addressed this in *The Law*:
>'As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all.'
'Socialists' is as SIC in Bastiat, but I think it applies fairly well to the american public and is an argument often made by the political left here.
II.  The democrats have the public school system.  I mean this in more than one way.  Democrats are seen as being pro-education, while republicans are painted as anti-education and anti-intellectual, which is a huge point in the democrats' favor.  
Democrats and their ideals also control the structure and content of schooling to a certain extent.  Public schools are places of centralized control by a government representative, in which all services (healthcare, food, books, and so on) are distributed by the institution.  
Students are heavily surveilled and given few privacy rights, with even bathroom stall doors being removed in more than a few cases (one, two, three).  Students are searched without warrant, and tend in general to have extremely curtailed privacy and property rights.  Students are taught that not only are guns unacceptable, *the idea* of a gun is unacceptable.  (Behold, the pop tart gun suspension, the finger gun suspension, so on and so forth).
Students who make it through high school and progress on to college find themselves in a similar environment.  Colleges structure themselves as a model of an idealized society.  There are only about seven states that permit guns on campus, with guns being banned on campus in the plurality of other states for one reason or another.  College faculty tend to be highly left-leaning, 
The net effect here is an indoctrination effect, in which people are made used to a system where the central authority is the source of services (healthcare, housing, food), there exists little privacy and few private property rights, and firearms and self-defense are unacceptable.
Students educated in this system comprise the majority of the voting public.
III.  Despite how anti-freedom the Democrat platform is, the republicans have somehow managed to make themselves *worse*.  They were in charge of the signing of the original PATRIOT act, they are anti-gay marriage, they remain largely opposed to marijuana legalization, they promote horribly invasive anti-abortion legislation, and of the two parties, they are perceived as being the more pro-war (although I don't know what difference there is any more).  Right or wrong, they are seen as the ones responsible for the massive surveillance incursion and war expansion immediately post-9/11.  The Republicans are also frequently seen as a threat to separation of church and state. 
Despite the fact that the pro-war, anti-marijuana, pro-religion, anti-homosexuality group is a demographic that will only become smaller and less relevant as time goes on, the Republicans continue to double down and lash themselves to the sinking ship of ridiculous socially conservative causes.
What's worse, not only is the republican party socially conservative, under Bush's leadership they were not particularly fiscally conservative, so they don't even have that advantage going for them.
Voters, faced with a choice between a party that is on the wrong side of *every issue* and a party that is on the wrong side of *most* issues are understandably going to choose democrat.  This is doubly true when people fail to understand why the government *shouldn't* be responsible for all social services, *shouldn't* take a more active role in the lives of citizens, or why gun control policy is actually gun consolidation policy (because the government always seems to forget to disarm itself).</td><td>Beta Tester for Will Making AI Bot Hello everyone,

I wasn't, however, logged out on desktop. From there I was able to see that someone had changed my email to some overseas account (.in India). I wasn't able to change my email back because it said "that email already exists"
Enter dealing with tech support. It took over a week and not so much as a reply. They said they've been dealing with so much Fortnight problem. If dealing with just Fortnight codes shuts your entire tech support down for a week, then you have some serious issues to tackle. I don't own or play Fortnight so the fact that it crashes DCU tech support for a week is annoying.
In fact Fortnight ended up being my problem. When they did eventually fix my account I saw that my previously read had the Zeropoint comics that supposedly gives you a code for the video game had been read. I have no reason to have read those comics, I'm working on a 90's reread. Since my email was changed they got the code for the game. So someone supposedly with an Indian email address went through all the trouble of changing my email to get the silly game code. And there tech help happens to be in India. Coincidence?
They tried to tell me to make sure I don't share my account or log on to other people's computers. I'm only logged on in 3 places and they're all secured in my possession so I'm going to guess my account info got sold from the inside on there end.

I have on-prem connectivity built into Azure US East 2 and Central - each region has a hub/spoke Vnet model, and I have subnets cut out for PrivateLink (PaaS connectivity) in each applicable Vnet.
I'm already planning on making the apps geo-available to INTERNAL (on-prem) users with automatic failover by using a third party DNS/Priority based load balancing solution to steer users at the USE2 / USCE VMs in an Active/Standby scenario.
    if
    application <exampleapp.company.local> is available at US East 2, resolve to US East 2 app server IP
    else resolve to US Central app server IP
    endif
So, my question is how will Azure SQL need to be engineered into this?  This is where I need some clarification.
\- I currently understand that we can PrivateLink our SQL PaaS, so that it is reachable via IP addresses inside of the respective Vnets
\- I also understand that SQL geo-replication will leave my primary (USE2) DB as r/W, with the DR (USCE) DB being left in r/O state until failover occurs, at which point (UCSE) becomes r/W.
\- Both the r/W (US East 2) and r/O (US Central) databases could be accessible via PrivateLink IPs in their respective regions/Vnets --- is this correct??
...Given the above information, my first thought is to ensure both SQL servers have PrivateLink IPs, then have each app server's ODBC connection be configured to connect to its respective region's PrivateLink IP.   During a failure scenario, when SQL becomes unavailable in USE2, I just need to ensure that my DNS/Priority-based load balancing solution detects this and steers user traffic to the US Central app server
\^\^ Does this sound like the way to build this out?  Have any of you done cross-regional SQL PaaS with automatic failover?   If so, what have you done?</td><td>-0.0176709134681536</td><td>0.6652456804957789</td><td>1</td></tr>

I'd come up through the ranks, so I was (and am) sensitive to the misery of supporting difficult people.
Even as far back as the time of this story, I hated fax machines. Every single tiny little organization in the company seemed able to demand that my group buy and maintain these stupid, fiddly things. As my hatred of them grew, I'd walk around and see them everywhere. It was a nightmare for me.
So, I worked with my boss and got approval for a skunk-works project to use fax capture cards and turn the incoming faxes into TIFF images and forward them as email attachments to the recipient. The project worked, and we scaled up the hardware until we had a box that had sixteen cards in it. We were able to eliminate all the fax machines in the company with this approach, and best of all each person in the company could have their own personal fax number. We could do this because we had a huge block of unused inbound DID numbers that terminated on our Centrex.
After approximately nine hundred million emails to the entire company and several training sessions (that mostly consisted of 'open your email from INBOUND-FAX-xxxx' and you will see your inbound fax' repeated over and over again), we cut over to the new system. People got new business cards hand delivered to their desks, and all was well.
Except for terribly-minor-executive-X in legal (TMEX). This person was apparently having a really, really difficult issue with the new system. He called into the help desk and informed them that he was unable to receive faxes, and that since he was an incredibly important person, he would simply continue to use the old mechanical machine. This was fine, and this situation lasted about a *year*.
After a year or so, the maintenance contract on the old fax machine expired and my boss told me not to renew it. So, we sent an email to TMEX informing him that the old machine would be retired, and that since **\*hundreds\*** of people had been successfully using the new system, we expected that whatever issue he had would no longer be an issue. And so, we disconnected the machine and rolled it away. Everywhere I looked, no fax machines. It was good!
Immediately on Monday we get a call from TMEX.
TMEX "I have missed hundreds of pages of faxes!"
Help Desk Person "They're on the log. Let me check something. "
HDP: "Yes, they were delivered to your inbox"
So the poor person on help desk escalated the situation to me, and I looked into it. Yes indeed, all the faxes had been delivered to his email and were sitting there unread. So I went over to see this super friendly and kind person.
He immediately begins cursing at me and blaming me for everything.
*HE THEN POINTS TO HIS PHYSICAL MAIL ORGANIZER WITH A SLOT ON IT LABELED* ***"INBOX"*** and he yells at me. "See???? There's nothing in my inbox!!! I've missed hundreds of super, insanely, ridiculously important faxes upon which the entire fate of civilization as we know it depend, you massive idiot!!!" (only a slight exaggeration)
So, I ask him to open his email. This insanely brilliant person has created a spam filter and put our fax system in it.
TMEX: "I was getting too many emails! You cannot possibly expect me to look at so many emails!"
So I make him a fax folder on his email client.
The solution was to have one of the poor, hapless admins get his faxes, print them out, and then physically place them in his 'inbox'.

A couple of years ago I was working temp services as a pc tech and got assigned to a company for what was supposed to be a couple of days, but got extended to a couple of months. The first day I walked in, I noticed that one of the enmpty desks had a huge pile of broken laptops behind the chair. Every couple of days, one of my fellow techs would walk past and put another broken laptop on top. I finally asked one of them why they were doing that. That's when I was told that the desk belonged to "Dave", one of the shift supervisors.
He had put a rule in place that nobody was allowed to recycle a broken laptop other than himself. We could recycle parts, but not the whole thing. Apparently he had gotten in trouble in the past because one of the techs accidentally recycled a computer that was supposed to be held on to, and he decided that only he could recycle them.
Well Dave got seriously sick and was out on medical leave for several months, and since he was the only one authorized to recycle the computers, the other techs just piled the broken systems up behind his desk. After the first pile got to about 6 feet tall, they started a second pile and so on.
Well, as his leave extended from 1 month to several months, the guys started leaving post-it notes on the pile. First it was little snarky stuff like, "We raise a temple to our lord Dave". "All hail Dave, the Great Recycler." "If Dave can't recycle these, no one can."
Then it later turned to stuff like, "I miss Dave." "We all miss Dave." "I hope Dave comes back soon." The piles eventually became a shrine to Dave.
So Dave finally comes back and sees the three huge piles of broken laptops, and first he is pissed. Then as he's going through them, he starts seeing the notes and alternates between laughing and sniffing. I know it took him 3 days to clear them all out, but I don't know what happened after that because my contract was over.</td><td>A lot of times, it isn't *actual* upper-middle-class people, but *wannabe* upper-middle-class people, a.k.a. karens, who inhabit HOA boards.

Okay so where I'm from there's two times a year where you can put anything you want to throw out on your front lawn and it'll be picked up no cost.

For kids it's like Christmas because it's common to go to others' trash piles and grab anything you like, one mans trash is another mans treasure am I right? I've gotten a desk chair, roller skates, toys, DVD players, a mini trampoline, etc. 
It's always fun to see what you can find.
And now onto the story and the malicious compliance:
So when I was 12 my mother sold a lot of our things, TVs and such included, and put anything we couldn't or didn't want to sell in storage while she dragged us all over the country for her book tour. We were homeless, living on the road and all that. 
Anyway, when we finally return to our home state we moved into a rental house in a city four hours from where we used to live. And then the unpacking happened, my mother had sold the family tv and so stole mine, which I'd purposely kept, and made that the family tv. I was understandably pissed since it wasn't my fault that she'd sold their tv, why'd I have to given up one of the only big items I'd been allowed to keep?
Months went by and then... then that glorious day came and my siblings and I were allowed to wander the nearby streets looking for hidden treasures. That year everyone had been transitioning from analog TVs to digital one so the streets were filled with analog TVs that were being thrown out, almost every house had one on their lawn.
I took my siblings home after some successful treasure hunting and begged my mother to help me bring one of the TVs home. It would've taken very little effort on her part to get the car and drive it to one of the TVs I had *walked to* and bring it home. We were both used to some heavy lifting so between the two of us it would've been a piece of cake and *free*!
But no... she refused, "If you want a TV so bad then you have to carry one back to the house by yourself!"
It wasn't a challenge or a tone that was in any way positive or encouraging.
It was a tone that said "I won't help you and you can't do it alone so just give up" with a hint of smugness, waiting for me to dejectedly walk to my room in defeat.
"Fine, just make sure to hold the door open for me when I get back so I can get it inside!" I turned and left, determined to prove her wrong.
"Yeah sure you will." She had replied, Sarcastically.
So I went front lawn to front lawn looking for a good TV. There were many that were way too big to carry and other that didn't have any good way for on singular person to grip them and would slip when I tried to pick them up. Eventually though, about two blocks from our house I found a, still relatively large, TV with two grip holds and was square enough for me to pick up. 
I lugged that thing, arms protesting and back aching, the whole way home and set it down right in front of the door.
Knock Knock Knock!
"MUM COME HOLD THE FRONT DOOR OPEN FOR ME!!"
The look on her face was *priceless*! She just stood there, dumbfounded, before I reminded her that I'd only done what she told me to do.
I brought that baby inside and placed it on my tv stand, where I proceeded to hook up my DVD player and give my mother a shit-eating grin when it turned on.
I had that TV for years until I eventually had to put it out on my own front lawn when I got a digital tv of my own.
The funny thing about this though, is that the TV had to be moved a couple of times while I owned it, moving house and the like, and I couldn't lift it again. 
It was too heavy and even with my mother helping we both struggled to get it out of the house. Yet 12 yr old me had managed to lift it all by herself. The desire to maliciously comply and spite my mother gave me a momentary burst of super strength in order to accomplish my task.
I still look back and laugh at how my stubbornness and spite empowered me like that.

I mean, if you insist… I posted recently about my hot pink duct tape shoe saga, and I thought of another much dirtier and less fabulous debacle that I should share here. This particular issue pre-dates my election as union president, but most of the supervisors remain the same.
To recap, many years ago I worked for a very large company with a fairly powerful union. I was serving as a griever (read: complaint department) for the union at the time, though that's not a huge part of this tale. 
I was, at that point, working in a part of the campus that was *exceptionally* dirty at all times. Part of my daily tasks was to walk around looking for giant piles of carbon dust dumped by machinery and to shovel it in to barrels and dispose of it. These piles of carbon were safety concerns, because carbon dust is highly flammable and obviously the goal was to minimize the amount of loose carbon dust floating around, so I needed to remove it as soon as I was aware of its presence. Not an easy job, but I was super in to fitness at the time and I kind of enjoyed the physical part of this job. Now, given the environment, when I was on *shoveling patrol*, I'd be in full head to toe PPE. So tyvek, gloves, respirator, safety glasses... a pain in the butt to put on and take off. In general, once I started a job I'd prefer to finish it rather than removing my
PPE for 15 minutes, just to get fully suited back up and go back. 
So, this fateful day I was cleaning up a *particularly* obnoxious and large pile of carbon. My watch buzzed alerting me that it was break time, but I figured I had 15-20 minutes left of work, and it would be a huge waste to strip down just to suit back up in new gear for another 15-20 minutes . Naturally I opted to finish the task. About 30 minutes later I was done, out of my safety gear and washed up to sit down for a 15 minute break in an air conditioned break room. Absolute bliss 
Then, as luck would have it, no more than two minutes later, as I'm minding my own business eating string cheese, one of the supervisors walked in and asked why the hell I was in the break room off of break time. I told her about the carbon spill, and how it didn't make sense to leave the job unfinished and waste equipment when I could just finish the job in one go. We also generally prioritized cleaning up potential safety hazards in a timely manner. 
I was informed that I was being written up for not taking my break at the correct time, and that I was forfeiting that break by missing it. I told the supervisor she couldn't legally take my break time due to her deciding to change the policy, so she *graciously* allowed me to finish my remaining 10 minutes. 
I couldn't really fight the write up because technically we **did** have set break times, and the practice of moving break times was unique to the particular building I was working in due to emergency safety hazards requiring attention (this building was close to a century old, sometimes there were floods, carbon dumps, oil spills, etc... the catastrophic issues like that were our domain) and was informal, so we never had a written agreement allowing us to move breaks as needed for urgent jobs. 
So, shortly after, the 5-6 of us working in the building were all called together and informed that **under no circumstances could we take our breaks outside of set times. In case of emergency we required verbal permission from a supervisor to do so.** 
Famous last words. 
As you can probably predict, a few weeks later all 5 employees from my department present were called for an emergency removal of a combined oil and carbon spill. This is very heavy, very dirty, and fairly dangerous work. The entire factory had to stop production until we got this cleaned up, the plant manager was actually shoveling along side of us to try to move everything along faster. 
30 minutes later I realize it's less than 15 minutes before we have to go on lunch. I mention this to my coworkers, to which we all grumble. I explained to the plant manager that we have been told that we CANNOT work over our lunch break without permission, or risk write ups, so I was going to make a call to get permission.
I called every supervisor we had in those 15 minutes. Not a single one answered. Apparently they'd all gone to lunch together and didn't want to be bothered. I came back in and told the crew I couldn't reach anyone. They all tried calling as well, and nothing. The plant manager called our supervisors... they didn't even pick up for him. 
So, we apologized to the plant manager, and we went on lunch, leaving the plant down for an additional 30 minutes. 
By the time we'd come back from lunch, we'd still been unable to reach any member of supervision. We finished the job, cleaned up, and went back to our usual tasks as the production started back up. 
Apparently the plant manager **did** eventually get a hold of the supervision team because they showed up FURIOUS at us for going on our lunch, up until I reminded them that they'd already written me up for moving a break without consent previously. Apparently the plant manager and head of manufacturing absolutely TORE in to them for not answering any calls for over 60 minutes and causing production to halt. They quickly decided that they would no longer being enforcing that rule, and gave us discretion on when and how is best to take our breaks after that.

I was inspired a while back by someone who was posting their collection of world coins on reddit. Not being a coin guy I looked into how difficult it was to get a coin from every nation. While I'm sure people who complete one coin from every country feel accomplished it doesn't seem terribly difficult so I wanted to step it up a notch.
I have been collecting silver bullion for decades. Some rounds, mostly bars never cared much for the coins. This little adventure has introduced me to a world where after 8 months of heavy studying I am still firmly an armature. I honestly thought one silver coin from every country this will take one or two months tops. 8 months later and I only have the Caribbean. 
I must say the coin world nearly turned me off in the beginning. Between the absolute dishonesty on eBay, they over the top fake machismo of coin shop dealers, and dealing with people selling their coins out of their basement online it's a different world if you're not prepared for it. 
But after I picked up a couple and did some research and saw some coins I really wanted I decided to stick with it. I can understand how this hobby can get very addictive and while I can stop at any time, I just don't want to yet. 
I set some rules for myself to guide my way. Must be denominational coins, no art rounds. I know most countries don't even make their coins anymore and some of these coins you can't spend in the host country but as a general rule no art bullion. I also wanted only whole denomination pieces. No quarters, nickels, or dimes except where I had to like Puerto Rico and US VI quarters. Ultimately I only averaged about $10 above spot per piece which I thought was pretty good considering how difficult and expensive some of the pieces got to be. I had to combine some Dutch Antilles territories because it was getting deep in the weeds and pricy with Bonair and Saba silver pieces.
Ultimately I had fun, I learned a lot. There's a lot of fun coins that I passed up that I wanted but I also had to stay focused to finish the region. I'm still more of a silver bullion guy though. As I spread this out it doesn't feel as impressive as a couple thick stack of bars. But I think I'll keep going. I'm sure there's some difficult roads ahead like African, Asia and South Pacific coins.

She sends three FMs after me at work. I'm 22, my fiancé/FDH is also 22. We are expecting our first baby, I am four months along. We are also engaged, but are holding off on having a wedding for a bit. 
FDH's mother is a nightmare. She doesn't like me, and she hasn't liked me. I come from a "broken" family in her eyes, though I'd prefer to say I came from no family. I cut them all off for how much of a hell they made my life. FMIL has always made snide comments that I would never know what a mother's love felt like, that at least I had a dad when her three kids did not. Etc, etc, just really stupid stuff. 
She's right about the mother part— I never got any love from her because she ended up being put in a mental institution when I was five, because my father broke her. But I know that I'll love my child. I'll treat them better than my dad, and the rest of my family, treated me. 
FMIL's also made some very insulting comments about my other "family", which isn't really a family, but rather a large group of FDH and I's best friends. FMIL's told me they don't count as family, that nothing compares to your mother, father, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and grandparents when it comes to family. She asked FDH and I if when our child comes, if they'll call our friends by the "traditional family titles". I guess she was expecting us to say no...
FMIL, aside from not liking the fact that my old family situation was garbage, doesn't like me because I'm apparently not good enough for her baby boy. I'm not as tall as she thinks I should be, I'm not "as pretty" as she thinks I should be. I'm not as "submissive" as she thinks I should be. I'm not as "ditzy blonde" as she thinks I should be. Yes, she wanted me to be blonde. Too bad, I'm naturally red/brown haired. Oh, and I'm "too smart" for FDH as well. Ma'am, I have the brain cell out of the two of us. If I didn't, we'd both be fucked. (Not to say that my FDH is stupid— he's just got a little less common sense than normal)
When I first got pregnant, FMIL said something along the lines of, "That sure was fast, are you sure you're not seeing someone else?" FDH was offended before I could be. He told her off about it. After that, she started calling me a whore in private, asking which of my "family" knocked me up. I have been very clear with her that she should not talk to me that way, and that if she keeps it up, it won't be just FDH telling her off. 
After that, she stopped talking about it. 
Oh, she still thinks the baby's not his! Her baby boy could never be a father at such a young age! I must be fucking every guy I know to have gotten pregnant at this age! I've heard it from every other lady that goes to church with her. 
But she's... still excited about being a grandmother, even though she doesn't think the baby's FDH's? I think she's just fucking with me, but who knows.
Her biggest issue with me (now us) is who we chose to be the godparents of our baby. One of FDH and I's friends has been like a mother to me. A mom friend, if you will. Her and her fianceé will be the godmothers to our baby. 
FMIL threw a fit when she found out. "They're strangers!" "Two women can't be the godparents of my grandbaby!" "How dare you not chose me as godmother!" 
In response to this fit, we've put her in a small "timeout" of sorts. She's not hearing anything about the baby for now, she's not getting invited over to our home, we aren't spending time with her. 
In response to our putting her in a timeout, she called FDH's older brothers, who are very unamused. They have begged us to take her off of timeout so they can go a day without getting a call from her. 
AND BOY DO I REGRET IT. 
Anytime FDH isn't around anymore, she's taken to harassing me. She's started back up with calling me a whore, she's told me that she knows I forced FDH to do that, etc, etc. She said she doesn't want to be cut off from her grandbaby! (Again, if it's not FDH's... then how?) She's said that she wish I would just go away, that I was a horrible, HORRIBLE woman! 
She also spouted all this bullshit to her church friends, who haven't given me any sort of a fun time. Three of her church friends :) showed :) up :) at :) my :) work! And would you like to know what they did? 
They sat me down, had a nice talk with me, gave me some tea— no. They berated me while I was trying to pack up food in the back of a coworker's car (I cater) and told me how I'm so cruel to FMIL! That as a DIL, it's my job to be pleasant and lovely. I tried to ignore them— "Young lady, you will speak when spoken to!" 
My coworker, who takes no bullshit, sent them out of the store and threatened to call police because they were harassing me. I thanked him so much after he sent those batty old ladies away. 
When I got home from work, FDH looks at me and goes, "I got a call from Mom that you screamed at her church friends when they tried to do business with you." 
I laughed my ass off and told him to talk to my coworker if he believed that. Then I took a nap. Which leads me here. My FMIL's gotten herself a bunch of "flying monkeys" that are harassing me and then lying to my FDH about it. All because we put FMIL on a timeout.
Edit: BILs don't wish any harm upon me. BIL1 has health issues and isn't supposed to be dealing with FMIL all that much (yes, these health issues are really bad) and he has to pick up his phone anytime someone calls, just in case it's his doctor. (He is legally blind and cannot read the contacts most of the time) BIL2 has mental issues and cannot handle being called over and over by her.</td><td>Another IT person here, and I second the LastPass suggestion.

I have questions... I'm a not terribly unhealthy man in his early thirties. One month ago, I was diagnosed, and subsequently underwent surgery. My right testicle has been removed. One week later I was told that the tumor was a non-seminoma, and that it was an embryonal carcinoma. The pathologist determined lymphovascular invasion. I think that is the right term for it. I was told the tumor had compromised the blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, giving it the opportunity to metastasize.
  
Tumor markers AFP and HCG were both elevated before the orchiectomy. They did not test for LDH. HCG dropped to negligible levels after the surgery. AFP dropped a little, but remained elevated at a constant level (14?) a week or so later.  
  
A CT scan covering the area from my hips to my shoulders showed no signs of metastasis. My lymph nodes weren't swollen.  
  
The multi-disciplinary team consisting of urologists, oncologists, and radiologists decided to observe 'watchful waiting', rather than starting me on chemo. This decision was confirmed by specialists from another hospital after being consulted by oncologist. From what I understand this is all in line with the national guidelines in my country.  
  
Short timeline:  
  
Day 1: Initial diagnosis by general practitioner  
Day 2: Blood work, ultrasound of testicles and lower abdomen, physical examination, orchiectomy.  
Day 3: CT  
Day 7: New bloodwork. HCG now unmeasurable. AFP lower, but elevated.  
Day 10: New bloodwork. AFP elevated at same level (14?). Physical examination. Told there is no visible metastasis. I'm told I'm Stage I, and that I should consider myself cancer-free for now. No chemo.  
Day 14: Oncologist has discussed my case with team of specialists of other hospital. They agree to not start chemo, and to put me under surveillance, or watchful waiting: I am told I will need to have monthly blood tests, and quarterly CT-scans for the next year. And the same but less frequently in the four years after that.  
  
My next blood test will be on Day 35, which will be 25 days after my last blood test. I will get the results and a new physical examination on Day 40.
Based on what I've read in medical articles and on sites like <URL>, the blood tests in the weeks after diagnosis and orchiectomy should be far more frequent. I also read that my particular brand of tumor along with lymphovascular invasion give me a very high chance of it rearing its head again in the first year.
Please share your experience if you've had a non-seminoma, and embryonal carcinoma in particular. What has your experience been? Is my oncologist doing the right things? Is there anything in my story that jumps out at you?
Thanks for reading, and I'm looking forward to reading your responses!</td><td>Conservatives I know seem to simply don't want to have trans propaganda in their faces everywhere they look, myself included. Nobody gives a shit if you're trans, there is no need for a national parade every three weeks admiring how brave and heroic all trans people are.  
Where is the national parade for the father breaking his back to provide for his family?  Fuck that guy!  Make him pay for trans surgeries with his tax dollars!
Here's some conservative policy-- stop hemorrhaging several hundred billion in international trade deals by letting countries dump their slave-produced product on our consumers -- stipulate minimum workplace and pay requirements, EMISSIONS regulations (I'm talking to you, China), among other things to do business, period.  
This changes things dramatically.  
- The end of slavery to produce our goods (why is the left not advocating for this??)
- less shipping emissions / spills because less product is imported
- manufacturing and resource harvesting (also covered in trade deal language) will come home, leading to more jobs.  Resources that aren't native are where your imports come in.
- increased costs for now-locally generated goods due to sensible environmental and workplace regulation will lead the market to more non-single-use goods, that are high quality and repairable -- this cuts down on waste
Healthcare can only be made affordable with preventative care and by not covering people who are illegal immigrants or are actively/by choice not meeting achievable health goals, along with relieving other taxes for the middle class.  I think this should be federal or state.
Infrastructure can be more appropriately and efficiently handled on the state level with state and city governments and should be funded by gas taxes, fines, registration fees, and tolls</td><td>-0.0585386646442942</td><td>0.8251403772886113</td><td>1</td></tr>

Every couple of years (probably as they update algorithms), homegrown C# apps that have run for years without trouble are suddenly blocked as suspicious activity.    Usually this happens at opportune times when I have a deadline, and can plan to spend a couple of wasted hours unblocking as I did yesterday.
I would appreciate the suspicious activity protection, if the blocks were not so random, the error messages not so generic, and if the Norton interface was not so obfuscated.  
Norton 360 would be a good example of how not to build a user interface.  I can't be the only one who thinks this interface has been consistently garbage for years (but maybe I am the only one too lazy to find an alternative and move my protected systems off Norton). 
Can they please put more levels of indirection (click system tray to open one app, then another, then a sub-menu), more poor documentation, more buttons that are unclear, more sliders/security settings that do nothing I can understand.  If you can click on the suspicious activity dialog, you can click an exclude button.  Does the "Exclude Button" exclude the block on the process or exclude the application from running?  Click on the help icon and it brings up a page for which the first half of the page is how to buy add-on services.  When hunting for the right screen to access settings that matter (there is actually one buried important settings section), you can also find pages that advertise more add-on purchases.   
Disable virus/firewall for 15 min, and Norton still finds a way to flag my apps as "suspicious activity".    And when I unblock the program, and I click for example, a process that calls the database, my app closes again and the Norton "suspicious activity" dialog comes up.  I "exclude" that process, but the sqlserver or whatever process id has changed the next time I run the app - so I get another "suspicious activity" dialog.  In the meantime, the database file now is locked since the program failed on access.  reboot or find the process id to release the lock.
So, I finally called Norton tech support yesterday - I wanted to see how they could fix my problem.  I watched them stumble over the same menus, get caught at the same gotchas.  For example, they wanted to add my application to trusted.  Its on the file system, not in programs directory.  You can't click the shortcut to the app, it needs the exe path.  But you can't copy the path into their dialog, you need to walk the folder tree.   The supervising tech had other trouble when this was escalated.  Ultimately, one fix that worked partially was to have norton ignore certain folders (maybe not a good security idea).  But the labeling of this functionality is counter intuitive.  On the data protector tab, you can add folders seemingly to be protected.  But despite the labels, you add folders and files that you don't want protected.  
As an aside, the norton tech support folks were nice and were trying to help.

Little back story before we get to our Karen story. Not on mobile, English is my first language. Blah blah, you know the drill.
I work in the corporate office of a fairly large scale oil and gas company as an IT admin, but I've been doing IT work for the past 20+ years. At the time, I had just moved over to this company from a smaller MSSP in the area, so I am new to the company. While I don't know every little in and out of the company workings, I can still fix simple issues like software lockups, password resets, and domain profile issues. Stuff like that.
About 3 weeks after I start, the finance company gets a few new contractors as well. One of them is our Karen.
This woman is the definition of computer illiteracy. There are 3 people that comprise the IT staff in this building and we ALL have our issues with her. The main issue being that she is needing a password reset at least 3 times a day in order to get into our financial software program.
My manager, the service desk administrator, after 2 weeks straight of this, has just about had enough and he does NOT contain his temper well. So, he starts spending less and less time in his office, (when Karen needs her password reset, instead of sending an email as per policy, she walks/waddles down to his office and sits at his door until he resets it. Like he doesn't have anything else to do.)
So, guess who starts taking the brunt of her requests? That's right! ME!!
Now, before I get to the main story, let me setup how my office is laid out. We're basically one long hallway on the top floor of a new work park building. Directly across from my office is both my HR manager and my CIO, who is the reason I was hired and how I got such a huge boost in pay, so he and I get along awesomely.
One day, Karen barges into my office with, what I suspected, was another reset of her password. And, while I was right, she didn't appreciate my assumption. At this point, Karen has become more demanding and entitled, thinking we actually work directly for HER supervisor. Not even sure why.
Karen: The entitled waddler with no memory
Me: Your hero/stuntman
AHRM: Awesome HR Manager
S: Karen's Supervisor
CIO: My BOSS boss (Chief Information Office)
Karen: "I need you to reset my password." Immediately starts to walk off.
Me: "Whoa, wait a moment, Karen. I need to know which password you are talking about."
Me: "This seems to be happening a lot for only you. Let's try and find out WHY this is happening. Could you come back and troubleshoot this with me?"
Karen: "I just need it changed! I don't have time to troubleshoot anything with you!"
Me: "I understand, but I feel like we are just putting a band-aide on the actual issue. I want to FIX the problem so you aren't wasting time coming down to our offices all the time. Wouldn't you agree?"
Me: "We can, but it won't help you get this problem fixed sooner."
Karen leaves in a huff. Now, I have to explained, she was not being quiet. And voices carry in this office building, (bad insulation, honestly.) Within 5 minutes, my Awesome HR Manager walked into my office and closed the door.
AHRM: Sits down and uncaps pen to write in a notebook, "So, tell me what just happened."
Me: "Well, Karen came in and demanded I reset her password. Everyone here knows she's been having issues with it and I wanted to rectify the main problem. Karen was obviously having none of it and threatened to get \*supervisor\* involved for no reason other than to intimidate me into just doing what she wanted."
With that, she walked out of my office and into my CIO's office.
A few more minutes later, Karen's supervisor was in my office. She's actually really chill.
Supervisor: "Karen said you aren't helping her?
Me: "Sorry S, but that's not correct. I'm was trying to fix whatever password issue she has going on, but she wasn't cooperating with my troubleshooting."
S: "I understand. Would you mind resetting it just this one last time so I can get her working? She's already WAAAAAAY behind on work."
Me: "Sure! Here's the password she'll need to use until we can find the issue"
I hand S the password I've already changed Karen's password to, written on a post-it and she's off. As S is walking out, CIO is walking in.
CIO: "Hey OP. Mind writing up an email of what just happened with Karen? SDM has been having issues with her, but had no witnesses. AHRM just came in and confirmed everything SDM has been saying about her."
I wrote up a quick email about what happened and sent it over to CIO, AHRM, S, and SDM.
The very next day, I get an email to block Karen's email, computer login, and front door access. She was escorted out of the building 5 minutes after I turned off her network access.
And, to top it all off, her password issue? As you may not be aware, when you are given a temporary password in this office, you are REQUIRED to reset your own password upon login. I looked up the logs and she would reset her password correctly. The computer would eventually time out, but when she tried logging back into the computer, instead of using the password she had JUST SET IT TO, she would try to use the TEMPORARY PASSWORD! It would lock out her profile in 3 tries.
I should have realized that this was a full on PEBKAK error, (Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Karen."

This will be my 3rd attempt at making this post to get my voice heard. Hopefully this sub will let me exercise my right of free speech. 
I feel people outside the black race think that we all think alike and share the same beliefs but this is so far from the truth. It's true that he who shouts the loudest gets the most attention and that is exactly what's happening in our country at the moment. There's millions of African Americans that share the same thoughts as me, but we get chewed out or canceled when our thoughts stray from the status quo. There's many videos of us speaking out against this, but it doesn't make the news as it goes against the narrative. 
A little About Me before I get into it:
1. I was born and raised in the "hood". Newark, NJ to be exact. I still live here, not by choice but by necessity. 
2. I AM NOT OPPRESSED!! Yes I still live in the city I grew up in, it's not the ghetto by any standard but it's not the suburbs neither. I have my own apartment, a nice car, and good credit. Am I where I want to be in life? No, not even close. But I'm working towards it. Where I'm at right now is 100% my fault and on me. I'm where I'm at in life because of my life choices. Had nothing to do with anyone else of any race, it was me. And have a plan to get where I want to be and there's no doubt in my mind that I will get there if I put in the work necessary. 
3. I've always been treated with respect by the police. To frame this I'm not just a black guy, I'm a very dark black guy. The black community comes in all shades from very fair skinned to very dark skinned. I fall into the darker category. I've gotten out of more tickets than I've received when being pulled over. I've never been to jail. One time I was put in handcuffs because I had a bench warrant because I didn't pay a tiny ticket I completely forgot about. 
These cops were respectful the entire time. They even took me to the atm so I could get myself out.. lol..it was less than $200. They saw I wasn't a threat and let me out of the handcuffs on the trip to the precinct. When we got their, the officer even apologized and said unfortunately I'd have to put the cuffs back on to walk into the precinct because it was policy. To add my license was suspended because of the unpaid ticket. But these officers drive me back to my vehicle and said "I can't advise you to drive this car, but once we leave you can do what you want". This proves treat people with respect you'll get the same back. And I was definitely far from home in a area that you'd consider predominantly "white" if that's a thing anyway. 
I understand that they may have good intentions but they are going about it the wrong way. They are trying to get demands made by force and violence. I feel as though this is not the way to get things done as it's just going to piss people off even more. Yeah you may get what you want, but it won't be out of support but it what be out of fear. Fear of being canceled, fear of not being re-elected, fear of losing your job if you speak up against them. America is built on democracy. What I am seeing right now is not a democracy but a dictatorship. If you don't agree with us then you are DONE. We're going to cancel you and burn down your business.
The rioting and looting was the dumbest thing to do and should have been condemned by BLM. People say oh the business have insurance they can rebuild. First off, how are people supposed to go grocery shopping etc. if you burned down the businesses in your neighborhood? Secondly, when things like this happen businesses don't usually come back. I'm from Newark,NJ. Back in the 60's we had similar riots that lasted for days because of a rumor that a black man was beaten by the police. You can look the story up as it's still a big event in history. But what I'm getting at is that my city is JUST NOW recovering from an event that happened over 50 years ago. These cities will never be the same, and I don't mean that in a good way. Jobs will not return and these businesses are gone forever to never return. 
I want to be accepted for who I am. Not because the government or BLM said you have to or suffer the consequences. The way they are going about this is causing a bigger racial divide more than ever and is counterproductive in what their trying to achieve. 
Dr. Martin Luther King said "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character". 
Black Lives Matter don't want that. They want special treatment for being born black. I want to get where I am because of my hard work. Not because I had to be hired to hit a "black" quota.
I'm rambling and don't want to make this too long. But I wanted to get my opinion out there because me and others like me feel our voices are being stifled. And we are afraid to speak up because any deviation of opinion will get us canceled which is not right and makes this country no longer the democracy It used to be.
TLDR: Black lives matter is going about things the wrong way to bring change. I'm black and never felt oppressed because of my race. Things will get worse if we remain on this path.
Edit: Here's Proof for those doubting my ethnicity. It's sad I even have to do this. It actually helps my point above. You can't be black if you think for yourself.

2) We didnt speak often and he never mentioned the ice wall. I do not have any photos ... unfortunately. It was hilarious. Even sat on the edge of it and had a beer with my other neighbor!
3) He moved to Iowa a year or so later. Hows this for passive aggressive? Thank god he moved because Iowa might be just nice enough to handle him.

Concacaf rules so I included the Guianas as part of the Caribbean. 
I was inspired a while back by someone who was posting their collection of world coins on reddit. Not being a coin guy I looked into how difficult it was to get a coin from every nation. While I'm sure people who complete one coin from every country feel accomplished it doesn't seem terribly difficult so I wanted to step it up a notch.
I have been collecting silver bullion for decades. Some rounds, mostly bars never cared much for the coins. This little adventure has introduced me to a world where after 8 months of heavy studying I am still firmly an armature. I honestly thought one silver coin from every country this will take one or two months tops. 8 months later and I only have the Caribbean. 
I must say the coin world nearly turned me off in the beginning. Between the absolute dishonesty on eBay, they over the top fake machismo of coin shop dealers, and dealing with people selling their coins out of their basement online it's a different world if you're not prepared for it. 
But after I picked up a couple and did some research and saw some coins I really wanted I decided to stick with it. I can understand how this hobby can get very addictive and while I can stop at any time, I just don't want to yet. 
I set some rules for myself to guide my way. Must be denominational coins, no art rounds. I know most countries don't even make their coins anymore and some of these coins you can't spend in the host country but as a general rule no art bullion. I also wanted only whole denomination pieces. No quarters, nickels, or dimes except where I had to like Puerto Rico and US VI quarters. Ultimately I only averaged about $10 above spot per piece which I thought was pretty good considering how difficult and expensive some of the pieces got to be. I had to combine some Dutch Antilles territories because it was getting deep in the weeds and pricy with Bonair and Saba silver pieces.
Ultimately I had fun, I learned a lot. There's a lot of fun coins that I passed up that I wanted but I also had to stay focused to finish the region. I'm still more of a silver bullion guy though. As I spread this out it doesn't feel as impressive as a couple thick stack of bars. But I think I'll keep going. I'm sure there's some difficult roads ahead like African, Asia and South Pacific coins. But I can't wait to start researching and see what's out there.</td><td>-0.0585185346009744</td><td>0.6756508557118709</td><td>1</td></tr>

Two tips for the future would be:
1. Make your baste and separate it into 1/3's. Double dip as much as you need in the first container, if you run low pour some from the second container.  This way you have left over non-contaminated basting goodness.

Picture it, 1999. Lance Armstrong is about to win his first Tour de France after going into remission for testicular cancer that had spread to his abdomen, lungs, and brain. I think he went into remission a few months before the Tour. 
I, being the skeptical child of 11 that I am asks, "how is this possible? Wouldn't his body be weakened from the cancer treatments?"
"AccordingToMe, don't criticize the man who had cancer. This is an amazing story, just enjoy it." 
Over the next couple of years, Lance left his wife who stuck by his side during his cancer treatments for singer Sheryl Crow. Shitty. A little while later, when she got breast cancer, he left her for someone else. My radar was up, what a piece of shit person. 
On and off again, allegations of doping arise and I prepare myself. 
Several years later, I met someone who also had stage two lymphatic cancer, and this was about six months after his final treatment. We were about to go on a hike in park that has huge boulders, and he only made it about a mile over the very uneven terrain. No worries, he said he expected this and that because he was in treatment for about a year, he had another six months before he'd start feeling normal again. I could feel the wheels turning in my head. 
A few years later, 2012, I was finally vindicated when it was revealed that Lance fucking Armstrong had in fact been doping with performance enhancing drugs. Donors to the Livestrong foundation rightfully demanded their money back. His Tour de France titles and records stripped. His Olympic medals had to be forfeited. His name dragged through the courses of modern public humiliation. I clearly remember yelling out loud, "I FUCKING CALLED IT!"

The real problem involving world hunger is things money can't control. Mostly drought. When food is brought into these areas suffering from sever drought local government officials or local warlords take control of the food. They then sell it or just give it to those who support them. And having UN troops on the ground doesn't do any good. UN troops are not allowed to use force to reclaim the food or when "guarding" the distribution of the food.
America was under such restrictions when we sent troops as part of these UN relief efforts. They can't use force, even when force is needed. The first few minutes of the movie "Black Hawk Down" shows this. And the use of some force would bring control and order in most situations when the world moves to help these humanitarian disasters.
There are far too many people living in poverty, this is true. But the majority of these people can buy, gather, or grow food on that low income.

One day, my boss gave me an escalation to handle which I was pretty excited for, because it was one of the first times I'd been trusted to handle a site escalation from beginning to end. We dispatch a tech who originally says he'll show up on site Saturday morning (boo), but turns up on site Friday afternoon instead (yay!). Before we get down to business, my tech tells me he called the customer's 3rd party IT support per his ticket to let him know he is on site. This is important to remember: we HAVE to check in, otherwise everyone flips out.
So, I work with my tech and we can't figure out what the heck is going on. I can only reach half of the equipment on site, the rest of the site is offline to me. We check the other half of the site, and it turns out all the equipment is communicating locally across half the site...so it's like north Korea is communicating with itself and South Korea is doing the same, but north and south refuse to connect to each other for some reason.
We've had issues on this site in the past, and when the client's 3rd party spoke to our tech he mentioned potential ip conflicts. Crap. So we run out of time as the business is closing and decide to reschedule for another day. Since 3rd party mentioned ip conflicts, I reached out to them directly to try and coordinate a day I can have my tech go back out and I can also conference in 3rd party as well since it's their Network.
I came back to work Monday to chaos. Somehow my request for a conference call got twisted into we need to have their 3rd party on site, and in return it caused the customer to be upset as their 3rd party kept pointing fingers at us, and called me incompetent. Lovely.
Fast forward a few days later, and I'm told we're going to do a site survey, yay! /S. 
Tech gets back on site. We're doing our thing and I'm looking at old notes from the last time we worked this site, and realize one of the ports on our switch was empty when it shouldn't have been. "No..it couldn't be..could it?" I wondered aloud. The tech looks around and noticed a cat 5 cable just lying on the ground with a bunch of other cat 5 cables, but twist tied to another piece of our equipment. Plugged that sucker into our switch and the other end into the device we used to have it in, and right away I can see the entire site again.
My tech checks in with the customer who has been hovering over his shoulder every 10min, and the conversation goes something nlike this:
C: so did you fix it?
T: someone unplugged our equipment from your network which is why we only saw half the site.
C: must have been the last tech you sent out there.
T: actually it seems like it might have been your it guy. We havent been out here in months, and he mentioned to me last week on the phone there were up conflicts. Looks like his solution was to just unplug us from your network instead.
Tldr; 3rd party it calls us incompetent because he unplugged our equipment from their Network.

I'm merely putting some context to who will be ruling over everyone in the country, *when* California's population doubles, again.  It will be people who never went to a school that taught US history, its laws, or constitution.  
The voters will be mostly clueless about our system, and that's not an insult to them, because why would they know? Japanese people go to Japanese school and learn Japanese history.  I feel quite confident that their kids are not taught that they were the bad guys in 1944. Mexicans are not taught ''And then the US beat us, and won the Mexican American war, and they deserved to win. Yay America''.  Russians are not taught ''All along, the US has been the good guys and we should be ashamed of ourselves as a people.''  Only the US kids are taught from the US school system history books.</td><td>I bought a house with a Ring. Yesterday, after seeing this story, I attempted to enable end-to-end encryption between the camera and my phone, which would block Ring and law enforcement from seeing the camera live or any recordings.
Ring makes this intentionally hard to find and difficult to do. There are 3 steps buried deep in a menu in the app. Eventually, they generate a 9-word passphrase that's about 50 characters long. They advise storing this in a password manager, but they do not allow copying it to the clipboard (at least from the Android app). Therefore, you have to manually retype 50 characters. I screenshotted it, retyped it elsewhere, and attempted to reproduce it as required, but the app said the phrase was wrong. After checking it about 5 times, I gave up. Hanlon's Razor aside, burying the feature this much and requiring users to manually retype 50 characters instead of allowing the clipboard has to be intentional to discourage the use of this feature.
The steps I tried to follow are here. If others find an easier way to make this work, I'd love to hear it.
Edit: took another crack at this by typing on a PC and was able to get the thing enrolled in E2E encryption. But enabling this turns off basically all of the useful features of being on Ring (motion notifications, video pre-roll, shared links, event timeline, and about a dozen others). Why bother having a Ring at that point?</td><td>0.013511165724104</td><td>0.7519984132382744</td><td>2</td></tr>

We were presented with partnerships as a method of bringing new players into the game. This is simply not the case.
In the July 1st post announcing the upcoming partnership polls, Jagex stated:
>"We think it's worth taking a moment to explain how games in our positions can go about attracting new players,"
and
>"Looking after you all is every bit as important as trying to attract new people into the Old School family."
First of all, anyone with any business sense should know that is it far far more important to retain customers than bring in new ones, especially when using a subscription based model. Losing a loyal customer means losing a steady stream of money. Bringing in a new customer brings risk: they could either stay and play the game, or they could decide it's not for them. And let's face it, as much as we all love it, Old School Runescape isn't the most appealing game.
* It has poor graphics, by modern standards
* It has awkward controls (tick delay, tick manipulation; really the whole tick system)
* It is overrun with bots, especially in the early game
* It is extremely slow, and often isn't fun to train skills
* There is lots of necessary information which isn't provided in the game, and has to be found externally
I'm not saying any one of these points is a bad thing, but it means that Old School Runescape is appealing to a very specific type of gamer, and we are far from the majority. I've attempted to introduce several friends into the game, and not one of them decided to stick around and play after the first day.
Runescape is an incredibly unique and special game. How many players do you know who spend over eight hours a day playing? How many players do you know who have been playing for over a decade? I'm positive Jagex knows how incredibly loyal and and passionate their fan base is – **it is impossible to be ignorant of this.** If partnerships went through – let's assume ten thousand people left the game, and ten thousand new players were introduced. How many of those new player do you think will stick around? Even if we're generous and say half of them continue to play, that's still five thousand subscribers lost.
So no, looking after the current player base and attracting new people are in no way equally important.
Secondly – the partnership rewards we were presented with were never going to bring new players into the game.
Suppose you had no knowledge of Runescape, and you happen across this partnership opportunity:
>"Sign up now and you'll be able to decorate your in game house with a Dorgesh-Kaan theme!"
What is Dorgesh-Kaan? What is Mount Karuulm? What is Prifddinas? Will a new player know who Zaros is? No, so why would having their home teleport reskinned to represent him be appealing?
*"Hey, look at this. If I play this game, I can make my skin orange and use the Dramatic Point emote. I'm going to sign up right now"* said no one ever.
These are all incredibly unappealing to new potential players, because **contrary to what Jagex told us, they were never meant for new players.** The partnership "rewards" were meant for three groups:
1&2: Current and former players. Settled has nearly a quarter million subscribers on YouTube; mostly people who play the game, with a smaller chunk of the audience made up by people who no longer play the game but still enjoy it in some capacity. It is no coincidence the first reward in the poll was the Morytania decorations. Current players who are Swampletics fans will engage with the partners to get the theme, and some former players will likely feel nostalgic and decide to come back, either for a short period of time or a long period of time.
Some people like fashionscaping. Certainly someone out there was excited at the prospect of grey skin. Frankly, the yellow skin would probably look great with my current outfit. But I do not believe that anyone decides to start playing OSRS for the first time for the purposes of fashionscape.
3: The partners. If "Company X" is going to partner up with Jagex, they need to make the offer enticing – they need something to get their foot in the door with potential customers. Exclusivity is great for partners because that means they have a (temporary) monopoly on certain aspects of the game, and players are forced to come to them.
**Make no mistake: these rewards were never intended for bringing new players into the game, and presenting it as such is simply dishonest.** They are solely meant to extract more money from current players.
But at the end of the day, even if Jagex had been honest about their reasoning behind it, if they had been upfront and said it was meant for the current player base, would that even have worked? Are players going to give money to another company for skin colours and emotes – especially when they'll be able to access them for free when the period of exclusivity has expired?
As far as cosmetics go, the polled rewards were lame – and they would have to be. Old School Runescape has some very cool cosmetics: Champions Cape, Fish Sack, Castle Wars armour. A bought and paid for cosmetic will never be as cool as a hard earned one – devaluing current cosmetics was never a risk. These rewards were intentionally designed to be low value to players.
But when the partnership rewards are low value to players, they are low value to partners as well. When a reskin of a home teleport inevitably fails to excite players, Jagex will be forced to add value to the rewards. ~~We all know that Runescape 3's micro-transations started off with promises that Jagex would stick to cosmetics. That didn't pan out, and there's no reason to think this would.~~
TL;DR – Jagex lied about their intentions. The rewards were never meant to bring in new players, they were meant to warm us up to future MTX.
PS: I would love to believe that I am wrong about this, but I can not. To believe Jagex would value new players the same as current players, and their method of attracting them was through low value rewards - half of which wouldn't even make sense to new players, would reqyure a frankly staggering amount of incompetence. I do not believe the Old School team is incompetent. To believe they introduced what is essentially a road map to mtx, completely by accident, is to do a disservice to both their intelligence and your own, especially considering we sad the exact same thing happen in Runescape 3.</td><td>Yeah you only get taxed before withdrawn at 59.5 years old.

There's a few places it could be.
The first and most expressly appropriate place for it to be determined would be Congress.  The 12th amendment, which sets forth the current electoral college, requires that electoral votes be counted in front of the House and Senate.  If the House and Senate voted to reject electoral votes from compact states, that could prevent it from being effective.
This would likely be expressly a political move, most likely to be done in the event that a candidate won the Presidency, but not the House or Senate.  So the 2016 election results would be an example case of this.
The closest precedent for this would be the 1876 election's electoral commission.)  In that case, three states had contested elections and there were two disputed slates of electors for each state, as well as some other alleged irregularities.  The Congress formed a special committee to resolve the crisis, and the committee ended up going 8-7 on partisan lines to resolve all the disputes in favor of Rutherford Hayes and against Samuel Tilden.  
My guess is something similarly partisan would be the result of any Congressional adjudication, and probably would only be really viable for the first use of the compact.  If the compact were used in a landslide year like 2008, when one party won everything then it would likely not be challenged.
Based on this CRS report, my understanding is current procedure is that both houses would need to agree to reject a state's electoral votes.  So if the Houses were split on partisan lines, the votes would likely be counted.
The downside to rejecting the electors would also be that we would then choose the President through the idiotic contingent election system where each state in the House gets one vote, and an absolute majority is required to win.  This had a nightmarish failure in the election of 1800 where the House had 35 successive deadlocked ballots before picking Thomas Jefferson over Aaron Burr. 
Now, what about the courts?  Almost certainly there will be lawsuits aplenty filed.  What will happen with them?  Honestly I have no idea.  The closest court case I can think of in US history would be Bush v. Gore. but it's just a much different question than the pretty small one there about a recount in one state.  The courts would be being asked to overturn a large number of states' intentional laws about elector selection.  It would also of course be a hyper-politicized case almost guaranteed to tarnish the court's reputation in the eyes of a large portion of the country.  My guess is that the courts would defer to Congress, like they did in some of the silly challenges to Obama's eligibility based on birther conspiracy theories.
The states have *extreme* powers over selection of electors.  As to controlling what electors do one selected, it is less clear.  
As noted in Rhenquist's concurrence in _Bush v. Gore,_ the constitution "conveys the broadest power of determination and leaves it to the legislature exclusively to define the method of appointment" of electors.
At the same time, the Constitution also requires that Congress consent to any interstate compact.  Assuming Congress had not consented to the compact before it got to 270 votes, this could create a bit of a conflict, though the courts have generally only required consent for compacts which diminish or enhance a state's rights or powers.)
I would also question whether or not the actual text of the compact even needs to *be* a compact.  If not, it could be subject to a saving construction which makes it be treated as not a compact even though it claims to be one.
I did a long analysis of this before on NP which I'll lust link to but suffice to say, I don't think the NPVIC actually needs to be an interstate compact, but it's a close call.
In a good faith analysis of the Constitution, I think it is.  However, it is by far most likely to be adjudicated by Congress, and given their history on this subject, I do not trust they would do a good faith analysis of the Constitution and would most likely act in the manner which provides them partisan advantage.
*edit* swapped out a bad link</td><td>It's insane what a small amount of drug 21 picograms is. A picogram is 1 trillionth of a gram. A race horse weighs around 500 kg. I'm guessing 21 picograms is out of a small volume sample, but even out of 1 ml of blood (I have no idea how much blood a horse drug test actually is, but I'd be surprised if it's less than this), that's an insanely tiny amount.
For comparison, the human body has about 5L of blood. If you take a single 200mg pill of ibuprofen, assuming that gets fully distributed in your blood, that would be a concentration of 40 million picograms / ml of blood. That's 2,000,000x more than this test showed for this horse.
If someone knows more about the size of this sample or the dosing of this drug needed for a horse, I'd be interested to know. I'd be shocked in such a low volume is enough to do anything, but I guess the theory would be that these are remnants of a drug given earlier?</td><td>0.0135196544533371</td><td>0.6107790243682446</td><td>2</td></tr>

We loved the location of our hotel (Dauphine Orleans) since we could retreat and cool down whenever we needed to. The one downside was the drivers who revved their engines all hours of the night, but it is what it is. 
We at ate Brennan's, Commander's Palace, Cafe Beignet, apps at Latitude 29 and Arnaud's French 75 bar, Antoine's, NOLA Po Boys, Coop's Place (our favorite, more below), Cafe Du Monde, Acme Oyster House, Galatoire's, and Johnny's Po-boys the morning we left. All were perfect, but Coop's was our favorite because it tasted like it was made by a family at home, and they have a surprisingly amazing scotch selection. We already want to go back there, Arnaud's to have a full meal, and Commander's Palace. There are so many other places we want to visit, we're already planning on returning soon. 
For music, we went to Fritzel's European Jazz pub multiple times since it was close and had no cover. For our next visit, I want to go to Preservation Hall every night, what an experience!We also loved The Spotted Cat on Frenchmen street, which was wonderful except some other patrons were FUBAR and thought they were part of the band too. The performing band stopped once and the drunks got the message. Everyone we saw was so talented! 
We had so much fun reading about the history at each venue, including the old Absinthe House and Lafitte's Blacksmith Bar which I didn't mention above. I have lived in the Midwest, Florida, and California (LA) and none of them can hold a candle to the pride NOLA has in its history. 
Everyone (patrons and employees) we met at the stores, restaurants, and music venues were so nice, we can't wait to meet more next time when the temperature is hopefully cooler and the crawdads are back in season. 
Pro tips for other travelers:
Tennis shoes, any close toed shoe is your friend in the FQ. Streets are uneven and you don't know if that puddle is water, booze, or something else.

If you like partying in clubs, go to Bourbon Street. If you don't, don't go. We used it in a safety in numbers manner while walking from spot to spot at night. A few good spots are on Bourbon, I'm just old now . 
Finally, do your research, have some form of a plan, but leave time for improvisation or chilling out.

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>Candy, next cube over is responsible for Texas and New Mexico"         I look at the map on her cubicle and see lines crossing Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana.</td><td>My last name is almost twice as long as the requirement, but whoever created my username decided to use my first initial and just the first *four* of my last name, with the number.</td><td>Call before you dig... I'm working for a strange consulting firm that still isn't sure what to do with me, but the pay's good.  
  
   
  
After the [previous] gig, I'm told to get myself to a suburban office park somewhere in Missouri and join an existing engagement with Amalgamated Pipelines (AP).  
  
  
  
It's late Spring, so business travel becomes an excuse to ride my motorcycle. A day and a half later, I'm at my second home- a mid-grade hotel chain with the amenities I want- room service, a small hotel bar with a familiar point of sale system.  
  
  
I check in, clean up and park myself at the bar, which is sparsely occupied. I drop my laptop at the bar and start reading through the documents from the client as well as previous emails.  
   
  
Looks like Amalgamated has decided to assess and fix their cybersecurity in a few weeks, like cleaning up from a week long house-party fifteen minutes before Mom & Dad come home.  
  
  
I've been tasked with writing an entire policy kit this week. There's an external team doing some kind of vulnerabilty scan, but I'm not involved. My firm is also doing some consulting around restructuring financial stuff, but I skip over those threads.  
  
  
I find the docs I am interested in- network and infrastructure. Their regular IT network looks like late 90's state of the art- MPLS WANs between offices. The Industrial Control Systems (ICS) networks are much less detailed- the top level diagram of the whole network looks like marketing material- it's not a hastily pushed together Visio doc, but without specifics. There's some spreadsheet as an inventory- devices and locations and 172.16.x.x addresses.  
   
  
Ok. I do notice that they've handed over _nothing_ for the usual policies & procedures. I'll just buy one of those off the shelf policy kits and get AP to let me know what they don't, can't or won't do.  
   
  
It's imperfect, but that's what you get when you only have a week.  
   
  
A few more people find their way to the hotel bar, and we're all living the same life. Laptops and drinks. I notice one laptop across the bar from me with a variety of hacker conference stickers. The owner is a 30 something woman picking at a plate of fries and pipetting drops of water into a glass of scotch while staring at her screen.  
  
  
I go back to my room and slap together some slides describing my part of this project for tomorrow's kickoff and go to bed.  
  
  
The next morning, I boil water with the in-room coffee maker to make oatmeal, and make it to Amalgamated's offices.  
  
  
I get to meet the teams. My firm has a handful of management consultants, but I'm the only IT or security consultant. There's another firm doing a pentest. After the initial kickoff meeting, I'll get to try to coordinate with the handful of people I need to talk to. I'd expect to overlap with the pentest team to save time.  
  
  
Right as the meeting starts, I see the Scotch-drinking woman from the bar and her bestickered laptop. There are intros and a lot of backstory about Amalgamated. I really don't care, but I want to look attentive and easy to work with.  
  
  
After the meeting, I meet Ralph, Amalgamated's Director of IT. He wants to make sure I  get settled in. I follow him through a maze of mouse-colored cubicles. I think I'm in a sales or customer service phone bank as the people around me are busy taking short phone calls. Ralph has a neutral American accent, which makes me guess he's either from Central Ohio or he's suppressing a thicker accent.  
   
  
This distracts me. I want to force him to say "to be" or "needs done" and solve this mystery. After some chit-chat in his office, we agree on the plan- I'm going to give him parts of the generic policy and he'll assign Amalgamated staff to make comments. Once we collect all their inputs, I'll edit the policies and they can sign off on them. The next week will be spent poking people, fighting over wording and writing.  
   
  
Policy writing ain't easy but it's necessary. I'll be chasing stakeholders like Tom chased Jerry.  
  
  
The first day, it's sending emails and editing the policy template. I'm mostly changing names, titles and commenting out things Amalgamated doesn't handle, like credit cards or healthcare data. This isn't complicated work, so I get to take in my surroundings. Most of the people at Amalgamated have worked here for years. Their cubes are decorated with plaques showing how long they've been there. During coffee breaks, I wander around to see many five and ten year plaques of different colors. I'll have to ask Ralph when I talk to him next.  
  
  
Most of the office empties out at 4:55, but one woman in a cube near me sticks around.  
  
  
I try listening into her calls. Maybe she's renting real estate on the side. Her calls start out with narrowing down a particular property and then telling them either "you're OK" or "we'll be out there within 48 hours. Don't do any work in the area until we're there".  
  
  
Fine. I've done my day's work, so I leave Amalgamated. The parking lot's empty, so I deliberately ride over the speed bumps fast enough to catch air.  
  
  
Simple pleasures, like a dinner at Waffle House and a book. I ride back to the hotel and park myself in the bar to have a drink and catch up on other work.  
   
  
After a beer or two and some timesheets, I notice Scotch & Water at the bar. I wave to her and manage a brief conversation:  
  
  
me:"Hey- I saw you at the kickoff- looking at your stickers, you're on the pentest?"  
  
  
  
  
me:"Great. I'm writing policies this week. Did you get any details on their ICS systems? All I saw was marketing material"  
  
  
  
  
me:"I'd like to believe that, but I'd like to believe a lot of things that aren't true"  
  
  
  
  
I leave her be, finish my drink and go up to my room.  
  
  
Oddly enough, I've already received some comments on my drafts. Most of them are the usual- changes for people's titles, nitpicky comments on wording.  
  
  
And an odd one. In the Network Security Policy, there was a section that read like it was from the early 90's:  
  
  
  
  
"Any system with a dial-up connection shall use an unique password before being connected to the telephone network"  
  
  
I figured this wasn't relevant, so I commented with a terse:"I'm pretty sure you're not using dialup any more, so I'd suggest removing this or limiting it to fax/multifunction printers"  
  
  
This seems to be a controversial topic. This has sparked an entire back and forth between a few Amalgamated staff which comes to a conclusion that the Industrial Control Systems team can't meet this for all their dial-up systems and that it's overly burdensome to fix.  
  
  
This keeps me up at night. What sort of stuff do they have on dialup?  
  
  
The next morning, I get my coffee and park myself in my cubicle. Before the calls start, I poke my head over the cubicle wall and introduce myself to my office neighbor.  
   
  
me:"Hi there. I'm just a contractor working with you all. What are you all doing?"  
  
  
My neighbor looks at me and cocks her head to the side, like I asked a _really_ dumb question.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Neighbor:"We've got maps of all our buried assets. When someone wants to dig, they call us and we let them know if we need to mark the property."  
  
  
She points at a map of what looks like the western halves of Missouri.  
  
Neighbor:"I'm responsible for the MOARLA corridor. Candy, next cube over is responsible for Texas and New Mexico"  
  
  
I look at the map on her cubicle and see lines crossing Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana. There are details as well. I see components of the pipelines and other details in small print.  
  
  
I hear a voice booming behind me. It comes from a large, bearded man who consciously flexes his muscles. I know he has an axe. I just hope it isn't in his office. I'll call him Tormund.  
   
  
  
  
  
  
Tormund:"I need you to be more reasonable with your policies"  
  
  
  
  
Tormund:"Unique passwords are too hard to manage. Our systems aren't connected to the Internet, so it doesn't matter. I also want the airgap testing requirement out of the policy"  
  
  
  
  
Tormund:"Yes. I'm a manager in the Industrial Controls department."  
  
  
  
  
   
  
I'm imagining what's going on in his head. It's not pretty.  
  
  
I put my hands up.  
  
  
me:"You say your systems are airgapped, but won't test to make sure"  
  
  
Tormund's nostrils flare.  
  
 
Tormund:"If you can't read the diagram we sent you, we should replace you with someone who can"  
   
  
me:"Look, I'll figure out who can sign off on this. I'll let you know"  
  
  
Tormund grunts and walks off. This is going to be fun.  
   
  
Thankfully the rest of the day is filled with less threatening meetings, comments on documents and listening into the "Call before you dig" calls.  
  
  
One caller seems to be a bit demanding. This reminds me of my help desk days. I can't hear the caller, but I can hear Candy's voice.  
  
  
Candy:"Sir, I understand that it's your land. We bought the rights to have a pipeline there"  
  
  
  
  
  
Candy:"Let me assure you, if you dig through our 12 inch pipeline, damage to your auger is the least of your worries."  
  
  
We all have a laugh at this. Candy seems to have calmed down her angry Texan.  
  
  
Everybody filters out by 5, but I'm still waiting on some edits before I leave. I take the opportunity to walk through the cube maze.  
  
  
I stop at Candy's cube and look at her map to get an idea how these pipelines work. Pipelines are layered networks. At the bottom of their OSI model, there are long tubes filled with petroleum products. On top of them are thin electrical networks to power pumps, sensors and valves and their controllers. On top of that, there's a conventional network controlling all this.  
  
  
That network runs back to control buildings.  
   
  
All this makes sense to me. There are faint notes on the map as well. I note many of the controllers have four or ten digit numbers faintly written next to them.  
  
  
I look around, then take a few pictures with my phone.  
  
  
My phone buzzes. It's a demanding email from the Director of Industrial Controls, who I assume is Tormund's boss. Since their systems are airgapped, they feel that it's absolutely ridiculous that they should have to meet unreasonable standards, let alone let those standards be written down in a policy document. More than a few people at my firm are cc'd.  
  
  
I've had enough for the day. I go back to the hotel, change and try to find decent barbecue. Sadly, all I can find is a Bandana's, which will have to suffice.  
  
  
As I see it, I'm either going to have to go to my boss and get some cover or capitulate to the ICS Wildlings.  
  
  
I plead with the waitress to bring me a plain seltzer, even trying to explain that the little switch on the side of the dispenser can be used to make this.  
  
  
She brings me a Sprite and I am sad.  
   
  
I'm mashing at my phone, getting sweet barbecue sauce on the screen when the picture of the map from Candy's cubicle comes up. Out of idleness, I swipe around the map of Texas.  
  
  
I don't know why I write down the number written on the map. I really don't know why I decide to call it.  
  
  
It answers after three rings.  
   
  
EoooooEEEEEEEoooooHHHHHHH ping ping ping ping.  
  
  
I'm a kid of the 90's. I know what a modem attempting a handshake sounds like.  
   
  
I use a few napkins and the cup of Sprite to wash my hands, I drop more than sufficient money on the table and run out of the restaurant. I pull on my helmet, jacket and gloves and make good time back to the hotel. I run to my room before taking off my helmet.  
   
  
Fifteen minutes and twenty dollars later in the hotel's business center, I have printed off Candy's map. I sit at the bar, drinking cold seltzer and calling up modems, marking the results on the printout. A few turn out to be actual humans in a port facility or control room. Some guessing later and I figure out the area codes and exchanges for most of the other numbers on the map.  
  
  
I'm practically spinning on my barstool. I see Scotch & Water walk into the bar. I walk over to her disappointment.  
  
  
me:"How would you like some high findings on your pentest report?"  
  
  
Her annoyance turns into amusement as I walk her through what I found out, including dialing one of the modems.  
    
   
She opens her laptop and starts chatting with her team to work out a test plan, then closes her laptop.  
   
  
  
  
me:"I want to write good policy, and I'm going to guess that your team will have a reportable finding that you can tell the client tomorrow. I'm hoping this might make them listen to me"  
  
  
She looks dubious, but buys me sufficient mid grade booze to let me sleep.  
   
  
The next morning, I send a meeting request to Tormund and his boss to discuss a way forward. That meeting gets accepted, then cancelled due to a "more pressing security matter".  
   
  
I re-write the policy requiring unique passwords, validation of airgaps and failed login detection. I put a comment in the document about how these are 'reasonable' controls in an increasingly dangerous world. Nobody seems to quibble about this.

It all really depends on where you place the goalposts.</td><td>The idea that "Democrats are conservatives in Europe" is a Reddit meme that is at best half true. Some aspects of the role of government are just different in Europe, and that's fine. In particular, both the employer-employee relationship (limits on hours, rules about wages, required time off, etc.) and healthcare systems are just different as a norm. It's not so much that the conservatives in Europe don't support privatizing health insurance, as much as it is that this just isn't a political position that is discussed. Some of this is just cultural. For example, a policy to only allow government communications, schools, and businesses in the dominant language would be called "racist" by the American left, but is accepted in France. 
However, there are many mainstream positions in Europe that are far closer to the American right in other issues. You already mentioned immigration. European taxes are less progressive than American taxes but the Democrats want to tax the rich even more (in fact, as measured by how much tax the rich pay, the US has the most progressive tax system in the OECD). Countries like Sweden have privatized pensions and what we would call school choice, where parents can direct government money to private schools instead of public ones. 
Many Democrats in the US support positions that are left of Europe, such as wealth taxes, apportioning government benefits based on race, outlawing gas cars, or disfavoring merit-based immigration.
In reality, the cultures are just different. Europeans prefer a larger government in general, which is fine. But it's not as simple as saying that Republicans are off the chart to the right in Europe on all issues.</td><td>0.0135305935311952</td><td>0.7585837591571546</td><td>2</td></tr>

Both of my knees haven't been in the best shape for at least six years, to the point where after long periods of walking, the right one will act as if it wants to disconnect from the knee. If I'm not careful, the knee will completely disconnect from the rest of the leg and I go down screaming. The left knee is creaky and tends to start "clicking" a lot after long walks, but has so far shown no sign of wanting to pop out. We were at the county fair for about six hours last week and both knees weren't doing much but creaking by the time I got home.
I'm just wondering - what's a "safe" type of HITT workout for me, I guess until I lose some of the weight enough to start actually running? I do NOT want my knee slipping out of place while I'm on the treadmill, so I'm trying to use machines at the gym that give me a bit more control over the way my legs are moving. I'm also not sure how long I can safely be exercising my legs with this condition and still burn at least 500 calories per gym trip.</td><td>The only caveat to your argument that I can think of is the fact the student loan debt is not dischargeable through bankruptcy. With just about any other debt (Main other exeception is IRS liabilities) you can file for bankruptcy and start over. This is not an option with student loan debt.
I am pretty sure that this policy of changing the law about being able to discharge student loan debt is due to some Dr's graduating with a lot of student loan debt, declaring bankruptcy and then being able to start their practice debt free. This pissed people off.`
So, rather than forgiving loans, it seems to me the "solution" to this student loan problem is to make the debts dischargeable. The problem with this, of course, is that the lenders made the loans on the assumption that they would not be dischargeable.

First,  remove all Intel Pentium and Celeron computer processor chips from  personal computers (desktops, laptops and notebooks) as these were  either developed or manufactured in Israel.
Note that the  revolutionary new Ivy Bridge processor will be manufactured in  Israel. Any computers running the Windows XT operating system must be  turned off immediately as this was developed in Israel. All current  Microsoft operating systems are not to be used as Microsoft is heavily  reliant on its Israel R&D centre.
**Step 2**.  Any computers that still work need to have their anti-virus software  and personal firewalls removed as this technology originated in Israel.  The organisation's firewall will also need to be switched off. Staff  should no longer open external emails as most of these will be infected  with viruses. No outgoing emails can be sent. The algorithm (code)  that's used today for sending e-mails, was made by an Israeli who worked  at the Ben-Gurion University in Be'er-Sheva in 1980.
**Step 3**.  Discard all mobile phones, as this technology was developed in Israel,  where the first mobile phones were manufactured. Mobile chip technology  from a single Israeli company has now been installed in over 100 million  devices. Only top-level staff may retain mobile phones for emergency  situations. However the use of SMS (Texting) is expressly forbidden as  this facility was developed in Israel. No 4G devices can be used, as the  chipset is Israeli.
**Step 4**. Turn off  your voice-mail service and delete any recorded messages. Israeli  companies invented the voice-mail system. If someone you do not know  answers your phone-call, then hang up. Israeli call-centres and  call-centre technology is in widespread operation in the UK.
**Step 5**.  Before accepting any printed material, check that the supplier has not  used the Israeli device that might have saved up to 50% of the ink used.
**Step 6**.  At home, do not use Facebook as many in-built and add-on applications  are Israeli-developed. Do not watch videos on the Internet as the  platform used to upload them may be from AOL and hence from an Israeli  company. Do not use the Internet to search for answers to your questions  as this may involve use of an Israeli-developed search engine. Better  to remain unenlightened.
**Step 7**. On your  TV or home entertainment centre, do not use Video On Demand (VOD) to  watch movies as you may inadvertently see an advert displayed  using Israeli software. Do not purchase any games devices as these are  likely to use Israeli technology.
**Step 8**.  Do not read books using an e-book as this may contain Israeli  technology. Do not use data storage as it may have been developed at  Israel's storage technology R&D center.
**Step 9**.  Do not buy an electric car as it is likely to be powered with  an Israeli battery or use Israeli developed charging mats. Continue to  sit in traffic knowing that you are polluting the environment and  financing oil-rich despotic regimes.
Turning to  food and drink, all food outlets on the organisation's premises must  dispose of cherry tomatoes, which were developed in Israel. Staff must  ensure that no cherry tomatoes are included in sandwiches brought into  office premises. The ban also applies to honey and any products derived  from honey. Israel has developed solutions to the worldwide problem of  bee-colony collapse, so that any products derived from bees might only  be available now due to an Israeli invention.
Avoid  drinking any of the world-recognized award-winning Israeli wines. Do not  consume homemade drinks from Israeli-manufactured household drinks  machines.
Avoid any fruit from South Africa or Peru as produce from these countries is being marketed with Israeli brand names.
No  agricultural products from the following areas must be consumed as they  use water irrigation and agricultural technology provided directly from  Israel. This includes most of Africa, China, India, Indonesia (a Muslim  country), Nepal and many others.
Much fruit and  vegetables (including organic) imported into the UK has been enhanced  using Israeli technology. This may save millions of people from starving  around the world, but is not a good reason for you to eat it. To be  safe, only eat fruit and vegetables that you have grown yourself using  seeds that have been in your family for generations.
Destroy  all personal medication. Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals, the largest  generic drugs company in the world, will have manufactured many of your  medicines.  Staff with the following illnesses will need to take  specific precautions.
Cancer – do not take any form of  medication or treatment. Israeli scientists have been working at the  forefront of oncology for decades.
AIDS and HIV – beware;  researchers at Israel's Weizmann Institute or Hebrew University  developed or improved AZT and Hypericin-based drugs; they have also  developed a treatment that destroys HIV-infected cells without damaging  healthy ones.
Diabetes – do not measure or inject Insulin using the devices developed by Israeli scientists.
Multiple  Sclerosis – stop taking Copaxone, one of the most efficient medicines  and the only non-interferon agent, as Teva developed it.  Don't  touch Laquinimod either.
Parkinson's – remove the  Israel-pioneered brain pacemaker to stop tremors. Discontinue Levodopa,  which reduces motor disturbances. Cease sessions that involve magnetic  cortex stimulation.
Staff with a family history of heart  disease and arteriosclerosis must not use the Israeli device for early  detection of these.  Rather, wait until onset of the disease.
Epileptics  – stop treatment that may have benefited from the Israeli discovery of  the underlying mutant gene; also throw away the bracelet that sends out  an alert when a person goes into seizure.
Staff or relatives with Age-related Macular Degeneration – remove Israeli implants that arrest the disease.
Liver disease – abandon Israeli-developed antibody immunotherapy treatments.
Emphysema – steer clear of the Israeli protein replacement therapy.
Myeloma – stop taking the drug Velcade, which was developed over a period of 30 years by scientists at Haifa.
Sleep apnea – no tests using the breakthrough Israeli device for diagnosis.
Dyslexics must not benefit from the Israeli Internet-based reading system.
Skin allergies must be treated with steroid creams only, as the new safer non-steroid alternative is Israeli.
Any  incident of stroke or head trauma or onset of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,  MS, epilepsy, glaucoma or brain tumor must avoid using any of the  Weizmann Institute's patented methods of treatment.
Before  any surgery or medical tests, check that hospital catheters have not  been protected from infection using the new plastic from Israel that  disables microorganisms. Avoid throat surgery as this may utilize  Israeli surgical lasers.
Ensure any colonoscopy or gastro  investigation does not use internal Israeli cameras such as the  Pillcam.  Never undergo surgery to install an artificial heart, as the  first artificial heart transplant took place in Israel.
Kidney  transplant patients must wait for donors of the same blood group as  only Israel's revolutionary new methods allow donors from other blood  groups.  Staff of Arab origin must not make use of the only database for  matching potential Arab donors of bone-marrow – in Israel.
In  the event of a spinal injury or disease, do not accept spinal  implants – likely to be an Israeli product or development. Heart rhythm  problems must not be solved with the Israeli-developed heart pulse  generator. All heart stents are off-limits as most of these originate  from Israeli medical companies.
Check all vaccines as many  of these have been developed in Israel.  Ensure that all X-rays do  carry a radiation risk, as the only radiation-free system is  Israeli.  Treatments derived from Stem Cell research must be avoided  as most of these are Israeli-developed.
If you or your  family are struck with a bacterial infection, do not take alternatives  to older, ineffective bacteria-resistant antibiotics, as an  Israeli discovery will have been responsible for the modern, effective  drugs. Check that any pain relief medication is not based on soya as an  Israeli doctor discovered the beneficial effect of the soya bean.
Do  not use the revolutionary new Israeli bandage that saved the life of  Arizona senator Gabriella Giffords after she was shot in the head.  If  you break a bone badly, reject any treatment that involves introducing  collagen, as this may have been manufactured from Israeli plants.
Do not protect babies and infants from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome with the Babysense system from Israel.
Do not use Epilady (or epilator) – two Israelis invented this hair removal device.
Finally, reject all major dental treatment, as your teeth may need to be scanned with an Israeli-developed dental scanner.
When  interviewing prospective new staff or holding meetings with members of  the public or with individuals from other companies, it is vital that  you check whether they originate from, or are associated with the  following countries and areas. You must ensure that you do not have any  contact with people who have benefited from Israel's aid to those  countries. The organization must avoid any possible acknowledgment of  Israel's contribution to world relief.   In addition, you must obtain a  formal statement from the government of these countries that Israeli aid  was not responsible for the production or development of any goods and  services supplied to the organization.

Peru's hydro-electric power plants are also being built and run by an Israeli company.
Rawanda, Mexico, Chad,  Sudan (Darfur) and Malawi all have received humanitarian aid from  Israel, including medical assistance from Israel's NGO IsraAID.
Always  remember that the boycott extends to any individuals from the above  regions that have been exposed to Israeli assistance during the 63 years  existence of the current Jewish State.
\-Reject  all products from the USA. Analysis conducted in a typical US  stateshows that Israeli innovations were responsible for $2.4 billion in  direct revenue to that state's economy in 2009 and generated nearly  6,000 jobs.
\-Do not tutor your children in advanced  Mathematics techniques, which may have originated in Israel. Also, if  these techniques are used in your children's schools, withdraw your  children immediately.
\-Keen ornithologists should consider  giving up their hobby as many rarespecies stop off or reside in Israel  during their twice-yearly migration.
\-Do not watch the new series of NCIS as one of the actresses is Israeli.
\-Avoid going to any football matches featuring teams with Israeli players.
\-Destroy  all your recordings of Madonna, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Deep  Purple, Bon Jovie, Justin Bieber, George Benson, Moby and many, many  more artists who have ridiculed the illogical boycott and have proudly  performed (or will shortly perform) concerts in Israel.
\-Destroy  any recordings of U2, Lady Gaga, Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, Beck,  Rihanna Coldplay and any artist whose music has been recorded using  the sound technology of the Grammy Award winning Israeli company Wave  Audio. You also must get rid of any personal copies of *Shrek*,*American Beauty* and *Star Wars*. Do not trust anything recorded by Sony, JVC, Toshiba or Dell.
\-Don't go to see *The Black Swan* with Natalie Portman, or watch any old films with Elizabeth Taylor – both lovers of the Jewish State.
\-Do not stay in hotels or visit shopping centers owned by Israeli companies (sorry, you will need to check which ones yourself).
\-Do not have anything to do with the banks who are using Israeli software to prevent fraud.
\-Do  not use any credit or debit card as the Security monitoring system used  by the credit card companies is likely to be Israeli.
\-Do not buy an engagement ring containing a diamond as it is possible that this may have been cut in Israel.
\-Do not travel by air, as your plane might get towed by the Israeli-built "Taxibot."
\-Do not use public transport inside Amsterdam, Moscow or Northern Chinain case you benefit from Israeli transportation devices.
\-If  you suffer a power or network failure, be grateful that at least you  haven't installed the Israeli system that prevents power outages.
\-Finally,  you need to leave all your taps running when you leave home and must  never flush your  toilet, because Israel provides water-saving technology to over half of  the planet. It also is providing sewage treatment technology across the  world, including to the UK. It should be obvious by now that all the  measures specified in Parts 1 – 4 of this series of blogs will  inevitably mean that your organization and your staff will be completely  unable to function.  Let's therefore hope that the decision by your  organization to boycott Israeli products is flushed down the toilet of  history.

From  1966 onward Coca-Cola has been a  staunch supporter of Israel. Recently  the Government of Israel Economic  Mission honored Coca-Cola at the  Israel Trade Award Dinner for its  continued support of Israel for the  last 30 years and for refusing to  abide by the Arab League boycott of  Israel.
NESTLE
Swiss food giant Nestle will set up a   global research and development center for snack foods next year in   Sderot, a town in Israel's Negev desert, the Maariv newspaper reported   on Sunday. Nestle owns 50.1 percent of Israeli food maker Osem   Investments and the two together produce snack foods at a plant in   Sderot.
DISNEY
The Disney Company is owned by Jewish  Mogul  Michael Eisner. He owns a vast media empire that includes the  ABC  television network, numerous news dailies, national magazines,  Hollywood  film companies and a large number of radio stations. One  radio station  in Los Angeles, KABC 790 AM recently broadcast comments  by Jewess Gloria  Alred to the effect that the Islamic prisoners at  Guantanamo should be  tortured by having their "balls" extracted with  pliers in order to make  them talk. The news and commentaries made  through Michael Eisner's media  octopus are extremely Islamophobic and  anti-Palestinian.

**I think, you need the whole world to boycott All these Israeli Products. If you can! Haha.**</td><td>> **She approached him, she messaged him on Instagram, sent him photos of herself, and sent him her phone number,**" his lawyer says.

> "Although she now claims she was sexually assaulted, she did not make any such claims on the night in question, never made such claims to him in the months that followed, never contacted Staples Center security on that night or at any time thereafter, and never contacted the police on the night in question or any time thereafter. However, beginning in the summer of 2019, approximately eight months after the sexual encounter, she began demanding money from PUIG," he claims.
> As part of Doe's original lawsuit, she points to photos taken at the Lakers vs. Dallas Mavericks game, Puig is seen sitting front row. In the lawsuit, the alleged victim says Puig forced her into a bathroom.

> **The alleged victim says she didn't know Puig and was just headed to the bathroom.** The woman is suing the baseball stud for sexual battery, assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and false imprisonment.
Of all of the he said/she said cases, this has to be a pretty easy one to figure out, right? If he has all of these photos and texts, she's a liar. If not, he's a liar. Barring a case of mistaken identity or something, it should take about 5 minutes to sort this out. 
At a glance, his version seems more likely. The narrative there would be that she filed the suit to try to extort him into a settlement, not expecting the case to actually make it to court or not thinking about what evidence he might have. Him lying would mean that he is making up evidence that he doesn't actually have, and his lawyer is presenting this evidence as fact for the sole purpose of a temporary win in the court of public opinion. If his lawyer included any of this theoretically false evidence in his countersuit, that would be grounds for sanctions.</td><td>-0.0176577871990954</td><td>0.6392539881832626</td><td>2</td></tr>

HI everyone, I had seeked approval before posting this because I don't know who else to ask. I have lost my family support so the Reddit community is all I have left for help. I am about to make a major life decision and my gut feeling is saying something else. I don't know if this is confidence issue or a serious warning of life. Any help on my situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
I've been seeing someone for 10 months and we both have set an engagement date to have our marriage legalized and the ceremony (all on the same month). But as the days progress, I am noticing a very pushy behavior from her and family about wanting to legalize, have the ceremony and they are not taking my concerns into my account. They keep saying "you decide what you want." Not only this but I am having to make too many sacrifices to be with her. Not only this, but the commitment dates keep changing from her and family. They are shortening the timeline to get married because of auspicious days. 
Here are the issues that I am facing: 
1. My career is more in IT / government with cybersecurity and hers in automotive. She works in the private sector and I work in the public sector. For me, this is job security with good benefits, and as a manager, she has a stellar reputation at her company (which is her job security). The issue is, my work doesn't exist in her home state and I cannot transfer my job. So that would mean I need to make a big career change (basically a sector transition). And currently, finding a job for me is going to be a big challenge since my interview skills are not the best. And, I already make 6 figures, so going back from public to private sector, I would need to take a significant income cut in order to find another job. (Because mid-level dev jobs are difficult for me to land, considering my experience is elsewhere.). I honestly don't feel comfortable with this. 
2. I have a house with a very good interest rate. She has 2 homes (also with good interest rates). We both have worked hard to get to where we are. She wants me to either I sell my home, or put it on rent. And if I move to her house, she might not add my name to her house. And about the last statement, she said she would do this, and now is reverting back with her statement. So basically, it almost seems as if I am giving up my house for love. 
3. I am currently working on my masters from one of the best universities in the world. If I was to move to her state, and with the significant income cut, I don't think I can afford my education and will be forced to drop. With my current job, I can manage all my living expenses and my education. One plus point is that there are lots of downtime so I can easily make time on my class work. If I change jobs, I am basically giving this up and don't feel comfortable with this.
4. Going back to above points, my parents don't want me to leave my stable job. This job has given me a stable life and I am leaving for an unstable one. The risk here with private sector jobs is that you can be fired at any time, with no warning. They are worried from that point. Even my grandparents don't want me to move or sell my house. They also want me to finish my education and then move out. My GF does not seem to care about all this and keeps saying you decide what you want. I don't feel comfortable by this. 
5. She did request a prenup, which I agreed. And at the moment, she's keeping the details her financial details to herself and not sharing much with me. I have already disclosed all mine in what assets I want to shield (everything prior to marriage). With her talks to her attorney, I don't know what's going on and I feel the details are being kept away from me.....NEW UPDATE on this concern, she did forward me a draft version of prenup from her attorney and she is a lot of assets to shield in case if things go south. I, not as much. She has told me to have it reviewed by my attorney and have it signed, before we legalize our marriage.
6. Last year, when she and I were dating, there were lots of family related issues that took place. My family ended up disrespecting her family (and my GF) and her parents do not approve of my parents. My parents also do not approve either. I fought against my parents approval and tried to convince them to see the good side. It has led to a point where I am not in talking terms with my family (or possibly disowned). My parents think her family is lying / hiding things / or being wishy-washy. The other thing I noticed is that her mother is very dominating and only seem to want things her way (I see this same trait in my GF). Her mother is also very pushy about wanting a commitment, and legalizing the marriage / ceremony. I see this as a sign of concern.  
7. My GF doesn't like it when I talk about my family. It makes me think she might never let me support them even in their old age. Definitely one reason is that she and her family were disrespected by my family. So I can understand her POV on this. I am only concerned if we have children, she might not let them see my parents. I honestly don't feel comfortable with this.
8. GF and her family are not US citizens. In fact, her parents don't even have a status. So once the marriage happens, I would have to begin work for sponsoring her. The 2 concern here are (1) when our families met last year, her mother made a comment "*at least let them legalize the marriage so she can begin her citizenship work.*" (It was something like this). That statement gave off warnings in my head, are they wanting to marry for citizenship or for love? (2) My family asked about their retirement and health (and so did her ex), they don't have an answer. My family seem to be protecting me from all this because living in USA without health insurance in old age is very bad. Plus, their retirement is also a question, as they believe GF's family might not be able to afford and will depend on me and her. My parents can support themselves, but her parents, I don't know. They're not being transparent about this. 
The one good thing is that my GF and I have a great bond. She's taken care of me and so have I. She says I am very loyal, which is exactly what she's looking for. And same with me, I love her as well. Her family is very caring and have supported me as well. They've accepted me for who I am.  
So basically, I am giving up my job, house, maybe masters and even my family at this point for marriage. And also considering the family situation, this is too big of a commitment and I have to make a lot of sacrifices to be with here. I don't know if this is such a good idea and I no longer have my family's support, this also makes things uneasy. I am starting to lose sleep over this and keep thinking I could mess my life up. 
And if I do let her go, I will regret my decision. She's a great woman, and every family has loved her for who she is.
**TL;DR: GF and I love each other and we have a great bond/chemistry. But I am having to make a lot of sacrifice to marry my GF and this includes change in career, leaving a stable govt job and back to private sector, possible drop in masters program, leaving my current city for hers, and leaving my house for hers. I am making very big changes in my life to be with her and all she's doing is moving her parents to a different home (at least they are on their own). Plus, my parents don't approve this relationship because they believe this family is not being transparent. They are not US Citizens so I would have to sponsor GF (her parents might never be able to become citizens because they don't have legal entry). Situation is putting me in a headspin and unsure about all this, GF and her parents are pressuring for marriage ASAP.**
I can't comment but I can provide a response here...
> 10 months of dating and you're planning to get married?
Because her family and GF are pushing the commitment. I agreed to at least 1.5, then she wanted it by 11 months, and this weekend out of nowhere they want it by the end of this month. 
Their justification is that its an auspicious day, which I think is a good religious day. Her father tried hard to push this on me, I told him this was a pressure and he repeatedly said it was not a pressure, its all good day blessing (something like that). 
I told my GF about this and seem very upset with me, she was clear she wants a commitment (i.e. legalization). 
Also, I don't know if it matters but she and her mother recently made me to buy an engagement ring for her despite me repeatedly telling them I don't have much saved for myself (due to my masters). It felt like pressure. They don't seem to care and want things their way.</td><td>My legendary dog strat (silver) Managed to catch all three dogs within a few hours yesterday and wanted to share my strategy in case it helps anyone else.
Switch between mahogany and violet City going west out of mahogany and East out of violet City rotating back and forth using repels as needed.  Going back and forth between two adjacent areas over and over was not landing me any opportunities it seems like the dogs actively avoid you when you do that.
I happen to have a level 37 haunter but I think lower level would be fine, the trick is to have it hold a quick claw.  Once you run into a dog use hypnosis and hope your quick claw goes off.  If it does immediately use mean look and nightshade a few times to get HP low while using hypnosis again as needed when they wake up.  
There is always a chance that the dog will use roar but it is what it is and there's nothing you can really do about it except try again.
I used the master ball on Raikou, Entei took about 30 ultra balls and three encounters while suicune took one encounter and seven ultra balls using the same strat.

Episode 1
 - Thomas - Me, the manager and network admin
 - John - The older of my two other reports, primarily responsible for server maintenance, major application upgrades, and supporting our smaller off-site locations and their specific applications
 - Daniel - The younger of my two original employees, though here for the same amount of time as John.  Both longer than me, actually.  Desktop and server support, document management and phone system support, phenomenal people skills.
A little over a week has come and gone.  Jordan remains steadfast in his attempts to drive me and my other two reports to the brink of insanity.  Thus far he has failed a stunningly easy test I devised to assess his problem-solving skills, admitted to underage drinking, attempted to build camaraderie in a conversation with us all by saying "you guys know how hard it is to pull one over on my mom", and argued with me about the importance of locking computers when leaving them unattended.  
While he was away from his desk performing a task and I was talking idly with John and Daniel, I walked over to inspect the clutter Jordan had already amassed and noticed a password written on a sticky note.  
Ah, an opportunity to teach an important lesson.  I mentioned it to John and Daniel, and then waited.
"Jordan, what's wrong with your desk?" I asked upon his return.  
Daniel, who had been listening to the exchange from his desk, poked his head out from behind his monitors.
"Yeah," Jordan replied.  "It's that [anti-virus] management password you gave me.  You told me to write it down so I wouldn't forget it."
"I didn't tell you to write any password down."
I cut in, stopping the conversation and telling Jordan not to worry about it right then.  I again explained the importance of locking unattended computers, and let the issue drop until later in the day when I called him into my office.
"Close the door behind you.  About that password."
"Daniel gave me that password."
"I spoke to Daniel and he said he doesn't remember giving you that password and definitely wouldn't have told you to write it down.  You're sure?"
Intent on giving Jordan every opportunity to come clean I tried again.
"Like I said, I talked to Daniel and he's certain that he didn't give you that password.  I have to agree; it wouldn't be like him to tell you or anyone to write down a password."
"I'm positive he gave it to me and told me to write it down so I wouldn't forget."
"Jordan, I know for a fact that Daniel didn't give you that password."
"*I* gave you that password.  In an email, which also explained that you should change it when you log in the first time."
"Listen, Jordan.  I've known the whole time what was up and I've been trying to give you the chance to be honest, but you chose right from the start to throw Daniel straight under the bus.  That's not the way to build a good working relationship with your coworkers.  If you keep that up no one is ever going to trust you."
The conversation ended.  No apology, no remorse, no assurances it wouldn't happen again.  I reported this chain of events to my director, knowing that such a claim of dishonesty on the part of the HR director's son would best be handled between the two directors.  My cries would fall upon deaf ears.
The chronicles would continue.
Episode 3</td><td>Trust me: the internet knows your IP address. The internet *must* know your IP address, in order for it to be able to send you the data that you request when you pull up a web page or fetch your email. If the internet *didn't* know your IP address, you won't get any cat videos.
Furthermore, "your" IP address *doesn't belong to you*, plus it changes periodically. It belongs to the ISP that you get your internet service from; they just lease it out to you.
So, what you want to do is use a dynamic DNS service, or DDNS, something like No-IP or Dyn. You'll set up an account with one of those services, pick a domain name, then run a small program on your server which will update that domain name with the IP address currently assigned to your router (it's likely that your router has the capability built into it, so you wouldn't need to install anything anywhere else). Also, forward the ports in your router necessary for them to connect to your Minecraft server.
Now, you just tell your Minecraft friends to connect to your server at myminecraftserver.dynamicdnsservice.tld (don't use that, because it's fake; replace it with your actual dynamic domain name). They can technically still get your IP address, but *that doesn't matter*. And at this point, all they could do with the IP address is exactly what they can do with your DDNS domain name: connect to your Minecraft server, and maybe run a port scan, which at this point would only show the Minecraft server.
BTW, having an IP address *does not* give anyone your exact location. The *best* it can do is show that you use a specific ISP and are located somewhere within a couple hundred square miles of the address on record for that ISP's local office. And for some ISPs, they don't associate IP addresses with specific office locations, so your IP address might locate you to a spot thousands of miles away from your actual geographical location, i.e. the headquarters office of the ISP.</td><td>-0.0176568184795731</td><td>0.7669880413533205</td><td>2</td></tr>

I'd come up through the ranks, so I was (and am) sensitive to the misery of supporting difficult people.
Even as far back as the time of this story, I hated fax machines. Every single tiny little organization in the company seemed able to demand that my group buy and maintain these stupid, fiddly things. As my hatred of them grew, I'd walk around and see them everywhere. It was a nightmare for me.
So, I worked with my boss and got approval for a skunk-works project to use fax capture cards and turn the incoming faxes into TIFF images and forward them as email attachments to the recipient. The project worked, and we scaled up the hardware until we had a box that had sixteen cards in it. We were able to eliminate all the fax machines in the company with this approach, and best of all each person in the company could have their own personal fax number. We could do this because we had a huge block of unused inbound DID numbers that terminated on our Centrex.
After approximately nine hundred million emails to the entire company and several training sessions (that mostly consisted of 'open your email from INBOUND-FAX-xxxx' and you will see your inbound fax' repeated over and over again), we cut over to the new system. People got new business cards hand delivered to their desks, and all was well.
Except for terribly-minor-executive-X in legal (TMEX). This person was apparently having a really, really difficult issue with the new system. He called into the help desk and informed them that he was unable to receive faxes, and that since he was an incredibly important person, he would simply continue to use the old mechanical machine. This was fine, and this situation lasted about a *year*.
After a year or so, the maintenance contract on the old fax machine expired and my boss told me not to renew it. So, we sent an email to TMEX informing him that the old machine would be retired, and that since **\*hundreds\*** of people had been successfully using the new system, we expected that whatever issue he had would no longer be an issue. And so, we disconnected the machine and rolled it away. Everywhere I looked, no fax machines. It was good!
Immediately on Monday we get a call from TMEX.
TMEX "I have missed hundreds of pages of faxes!"
Help Desk Person "They're on the log. Let me check something. "
HDP: "Yes, they were delivered to your inbox"
So the poor person on help desk escalated the situation to me, and I looked into it. Yes indeed, all the faxes had been delivered to his email and were sitting there unread. So I went over to see this super friendly and kind person.
He immediately begins cursing at me and blaming me for everything.
*HE THEN POINTS TO HIS PHYSICAL MAIL ORGANIZER WITH A SLOT ON IT LABELED* ***"INBOX"*** and he yells at me. "See???? There's nothing in my inbox!!! I've missed hundreds of super, insanely, ridiculously important faxes upon which the entire fate of civilization as we know it depend, you massive idiot!!!" (only a slight exaggeration)
So, I ask him to open his email. This insanely brilliant person has created a spam filter and put our fax system in it.
TMEX: "I was getting too many emails! You cannot possibly expect me to look at so many emails!"
So I make him a fax folder on his email client.
The solution was to have one of the poor, hapless admins get his faxes, print them out, and then physically place them in his 'inbox'.

The real problem involving world hunger is things money can't control. Mostly drought. When food is brought into these areas suffering from sever drought local government officials or local warlords take control of the food. They then sell it or just give it to those who support them. And having UN troops on the ground doesn't do any good. UN troops are not allowed to use force to reclaim the food or when "guarding" the distribution of the food.
America was under such restrictions when we sent troops as part of these UN relief efforts. They can't use force, even when force is needed. The first few minutes of the movie "Black Hawk Down" shows this. And the use of some force would bring control and order in most situations when the world moves to help these humanitarian disasters.
There are far too many people living in poverty, this is true. But the majority of these people can buy, gather, or grow food on that low income.

When I was kid my parents always wanted me to be active after school, so I joined baseball and soccer teams since I loved the sports. At 14 years old I had been playing for a soccer team we called the Purple Punks and we were enjoying our  3rd league championship win, all my teammates celebrated on the field as a team for a while before all going off to celebrate with their own families. Mine decided we would go to a fancy Mexican restaurant where they made the guacamole at the table. Now for this story you must know that I was adopted from South America and both my parents are white. Anyways as we sat down for dinner at a nice table my mom told me to go wash my hands before dinner. Not a problem, time to find the bathroom. As I was looking for the bathroom a really old white lady with what I can only remember as Great Gatsby Era gown on grabbed me tightly by the arm and sternly asked me for more chips and salsa. All I could get out was "huh?" Before she cut into me for a couple seconds about being stupid and learning the language. As this went on I struggled to get my arm away from her but she kept her talons clamped on to my arm and raised up out of her seat and demanded to see a manager. Now I don't remember if she was with someone else or not but once the manager came over to see what the problem was. Thats when two other elderly white people came over and told him I should be fired for talking back to a customer. I couldn't believe it...I'm 14 years old in a black and purple soccer uniform, I still had my astroturf cleats on! Now that being said, if the restaurant had been soccer themed I might have understood  but all the waiters where in white shirts and black vests with black slacks, the manager was in a tailored suit, how did she think I was an employee Anyways, the manager kept telling them that I was in fact a child and did not work for the restaurant. He had to repeat this multiple times and in different but increasing volume because she would not let go of me. It took my father and mother to both stand up and race over to the old lady and scold her like an old dog. They explained that I was their kid and that we were here to celebrate but if the old lady didn't let go of me than they were here for problems. They threatened legal action against all the old white people helping her for hate crimes as she was digging her bird like talons into my arm as she held onto me and then said they would do the same to the restaurant if they didn't kick her and her lackies out of the restaurant. She started to get cartoonishly upset and tried to speak but my father told her in a very stern and threatening voice that his brother and father were both supreme court judges and he couldn't wait to take everything she had (not true but he was also in a tailored suit). He even threatened to take her casket when she died...damn you go dad! All three of them were then told to leave and never return. As they left my father then turned and apologized to the whole restaurant and the staff for the racket and disgusting display of racism the old lady had displayed. As I scanned the restaurant sheepishly, in fear that every hated me for this disturbance I could see a few smiles and heard even a few tables clapping. The restaurant offered to cover our meal in fear of legal action but we paid anyway and left a huge tip. I remember asking why my dad tipped so much and he said that the staff had probably been dealing with that old lady far longer than we had so I was only right they got compensation for that.

So I've been in the IT field for nearly a year now and I love it. But sometimes, it makes my brain hurt. Take this situation for example:
For my line of work, we provide technical support to technicians dispatched to various job sites across the country, dealing with networking equipment my employers have placed on site for the customer. I don't want to get too far into details, as I know some of my colleagues are on here fairly regularly. 
One day, my boss gave me an escalation to handle which I was pretty excited for, because it was one of the first times I'd been trusted to handle a site escalation from beginning to end. We dispatch a tech who originally says he'll show up on site Saturday morning (boo), but turns up on site Friday afternoon instead (yay!). Before we get down to business, my tech tells me he called the customer's 3rd party IT support per his ticket to let him know he is on site. This is important to remember: we HAVE to check in, otherwise everyone flips out.
So, I work with my tech and we can't figure out what the heck is going on. I can only reach half of the equipment on site, the rest of the site is offline to me. We check the other half of the site, and it turns out all the equipment is communicating locally across half the site...so it's like north Korea is communicating with itself and South Korea is doing the same, but north and south refuse to connect to each other for some reason.
We've had issues on this site in the past, and when the client's 3rd party spoke to our tech he mentioned potential ip conflicts. Crap. So we run out of time as the business is closing and decide to reschedule for another day. Since 3rd party mentioned ip conflicts, I reached out to them directly to try and coordinate a day I can have my tech go back out and I can also conference in 3rd party as well since it's their Network.
I came back to work Monday to chaos. Somehow my request for a conference call got twisted into we need to have their 3rd party on site, and in return it caused the customer to be upset as their 3rd party kept pointing fingers at us, and called me incompetent. Lovely.
Fast forward a few days later, and I'm told we're going to do a site survey, yay! /S. 
Tech gets back on site. We're doing our thing and I'm looking at old notes from the last time we worked this site, and realize one of the ports on our switch was empty when it shouldn't have been. "No..it couldn't be..could it?" I wondered aloud. The tech looks around and noticed a cat 5 cable just lying on the ground with a bunch of other cat 5 cables, but twist tied to another piece of our equipment. Plugged that sucker into our switch and the other end into the device we used to have it in, and right away I can see the entire site again.
My tech checks in with the customer who has been hovering over his shoulder every 10min, and the conversation goes something nlike this:
C: so did you fix it?
T: someone unplugged our equipment from your network which is why we only saw half the site.
C: must have been the last tech you sent out there.
T: actually it seems like it might have been your it guy. We havent been out here in months, and he mentioned to me last week on the phone there were up conflicts. Looks like his solution was to just unplug us from your network instead.
Tldr; 3rd party it calls us incompetent because he unplugged our equipment from their Network.

In the past 12 or so hours since the end of the OSU v. Clemson game I've seen a lot of hot takes, misunderstandings, and straight up misinformation about what is or isn't a catch. I thought I'd try and do a write up of this call in particular, mainly because what I've seen thus far seems inadequate.
If you want the **TLDR: I think they got the call correct by overturning it.**
Without further ado, let's break this down.
The NCAA provides for us the rules free of charge. I'll go ahead and copy out the relevant sections here:
> Catch, Interception, Recovery
>> a. To catch a ball means that a player:
>>> 1. Secures firm control with the hand(s) or arm(s) of a live ball in flight before the ball touches the ground, and
>>> 3. Maintains control of the ball long enough to enable him to perform an act common to the game, i.e., long enough to pitch or hand the ball, advance it, avoid or ward off an opponent, etc., 
>> h. When in question, the catch, recovery or interception is not completed. 
We will circle back to these later
>Procedures
>> c. All reviews shall be based upon video evidence provided by and coming directly from the televised production of the game or from other video means available to the replay official that is also available to the television producer. 
I do not have a copy of the CCA Mechanics Manual, but at this level of football, officials are instructed to beanbag fumbles and review them in the booth. If one of the NCAA officials on here could copy out the phrasing, please do.
So now that we've established these lets jump right in
These are enumerated above, but to expand on them:
* Tucking the ball
* Extending the ball for the goal line
* Moving the ball away from a defender
* Advancing under your own power
* Taking steps BY ITSELF is not an act common to the game. Maintaining feet from the point of contact is not indicative in and of itself a move common to the game. Imagine in this hypothetical scenario that that the Clemson WR had remained with his hands on the ball and went to the ground. He would have been marked down by forward progress where he initially contacted the ball, as he did not actively make these steps. So lets dispense with that one right now.
* Trying to do any of the above and failing in the process is not indicative of a move common to the game.
* The speed of the ball carrying it to your helmet is not a move common to the game. 
**Looking at replays and thinking through the process**
Unfortunately these are the only clips I have from the game, as most of the articles through page 3 of google simply use the sportscenter slowmo. If anyone has other clips please send them too me so I can edit it in.
So full speed, the HLJ is perfectly in position to make this call. He's about 3 yards from the play, judging by where his hat is pointed he's staring right at this catch. As soon as he sees the ball come out, he drops his beanbag and runs to the GL for the reverse mechanic, and the R signals the TD. As a scoring play, it immediately goes to review.
Looking back at the mechanics manual, the HLJ drops the bean bag to cover himself. If he blows the whistle and it was in-fact a fumble for a TD, he's probably never going to work a CFP game again for having an inadvertent whistle on a scoring play.
Now that we are in the review, we need to have firm control, and an act common to the game.
Full Speed Front View - From here we can see that the steps taken are from the force of contact by the DB from the moment of catching, the steps alone do not count as our move common. This leaves an attempt to ward or tuck.
Slow Motion Back Cam - From 0:03 to 0:05 we can see the WR left hand come off of the ball while attempting to tuck it to his waist, at which point the ball is dislodged by the DB.
Given this, I don't think this is a catch, but it's still a very close call.
Circling back to subsection h, *"When in question, the catch, recovery or interception is not completed."* Given that the HLJ let the play go as he wasn't sure it was a catch or not, and that it seems unclear after looking at this all day whether he completes his act common, this is ruled incomplete.
For games such as this, the call is reviewed at the SEC HQ, the replay booth, and on the field. Given that all crews independently came to the same conclusion, I feel quite confident that this was the right call.
*Can the replay booth/HQ overrule the field crew?*
No, the ruling of the white hat on the field is final. That said, he is subject to a post game review process by the conference.
*But what about hypothetical scenario involving goal line/out of bounds?*
You have to maintain control while doing your move. Simply catching the ball is not enough, it has to be maintained through contact \(see this play\)
I'll add more as I see them come in
*Do you have more clips like this?*
Here's a video where Redding breaks down a very similar play in TAMU v. UA. Notice how the WR successfully tucks and turns under his own power before it's immediately stripped.
Here's a video in which it was called an incompletion, TAMU vs. LSU. WR never completes his act common to the game before losing control.
This is an incompletion. Steps do not matter if you don't have control.</td><td>Maybe don't steal, then. Nobody needs to steal $250 worth of food to feed themselves or their families. 
Theft is rampant in major cities. People walk in, take what they want, and walk out. In Seattle, they put cops at a local Target for a few hours and arrested 35 shoplifters in just a few hours. Despite the fact that these thefts were "organized", taking specific items that are easy to resell, nearly all were charged with misdemeanors and immediately let go because it's hard to steal $750 worth of merchandise at once. It's gotten to the point where downtown stores are locking up more and more. Even ice cream is now behind lock and key. Meanwhile, the city has for years had a roving open air drug market where you can buy all your drugs and stolen goods all in one place, which aside from the occasional raid when they need a PR win, the city just allows.
What's needed is more enforcement, especially against repeat offenders who have been arrested, convicted, and let go dozens of times.</td><td>-0.0176494194339635</td><td>0.6580741503354239</td><td>2</td></tr>

I mainly do password resets for professors, tell parents that no, I won't reset their kid's password without the student requesting the reset, and telling people "no, you're not allowed to turn off the 2-Factor Authentication".
Some context: A little over a year ago, our university was hit by phishers hard, using spoofed email addresses for social engineering. Since then, we've required that all faculty and staff (anyone with access to anything important) use 2-Factor Authentication from $2FA Vendor. Users have the option of having the system call a phone number designated by the user, use an android or iOS app, or use a physical key-fob number generator that is capable of generating single-use codes, similar to various OTP apps (like Google Authenticator).
We always recommend that users come to us and grab a key-fob if they have issues, that way they can use their primary method (generally smartphone app notification prompt) with the keyfob as an offline backup.
If, god forbid, your phone is dead, and your key-fob has fallen down a well, users can call us, we can then use our dashboard to give them a bypass code for the 2FA. We can set it for a set number of logins, or for a set period of time. So if you're out of town at a conference until Tuesday, we'll give you a code that's good until 9am Wednesday at which point you will walk yourself down to our office, and we will issue you a key-fob and make sure that your phone app is configured correctly, and register your office landline or cell as a last-ditch option since you couldn't be bothered to do that when you first signed up.
Enter the star of our story today. She's an English professor, who is very busy and it's not her fault and why for the love of god can't I just make it work?
I got called in to work early this day, things got a little.. heated. My manager was hanging out at one of my coworker's desk, which was only unusual because $Coworker1 was on a call. Things were tense.
$CW1: I understand, this will be the last code we give you. We need you to come in to the service desk at your next convenience - Ma'am, I'm sorry this is frustrating, we're doing our best to fix it. This code will be good for three logins over the weekend.
I get the story, this user calls in once a week on Monday, complains their 2FA isn't working, and gets a bypass code from us for five days (she's always too busy and can't come in until the end of the week). Then she doesn't come in, and calls in monday and talks to a different tech, gets a bypass code, wash, rinse, repeat. When $CW1 pulled her logs during this call, he saw how many keys she had been issued in such a short period of time the decision is made that we'll have her department's tech check out her setup and get whatever her issue is resolved, and that we are *not* going to issue her codes going forward. Last thing we need is pieces of paper on a Faculty Member's desk with bypass codes on them.
$CW1 goes on lunch  (we get a half hour lunch)
Two minutes later, my phone rings.
$Me: Technology Service Desk, this is $StarvingCollegeStudent, how may I help you?
$User: This is Professor $Firstname $Lastname Marquess DFA III. It's not working
\[I knew it was our user whom we had just been discussing, but played dumb\]
$Me: I'm sorry to hear that, may I ask with what you are having an issue?
$User: I spoke to another gentlemen a few minutes ago, the code he gave me isn't working. I thought I could use the $2FA on a government page and I guess I can't and now I need a new code.
$Me: Okay, let me look something up real quick... yes I can see that you were just issued a bypass code, and you've had three in the past week or so. Will you be able to come in to the service desk? We can give you a keyfob that will give you codes so that you don't need to keep calling us.
(Bluffing, as student staff I don't have access to this panel, I was given this info when I was briefed on the user)
$User: You don't understand! I have papers I need to grade. I don't have the time. I would, *if I had the time. I don't have the time*. I need the code so I can get these papers graded over the weekend. Just give it to me.

I inform $Manager and we both walk over to $Security\_Director's office down the hall. We let him know, he confirms that we made the right call in not giving her another code. He'll give her a call as soon as he wraps up his current call.
I go back to the user
$Me: $Firstname, I just checked with $Security Director, he'll be contacting you shortly to resolve this issue
$User: Okay. Because, you don't understand. I need the bypass code so I can get passed $2FA So I can submit these grades for my grad students! This is a very tight deadline!
$Me: Yes, I understand, that is why the $Security\_Directory *himself* will be giving you a call shortly.
Well, that was annoying. I go to chat with a coworker that walked in during the call and update my $manager. As we're talking, my phone rings. Same phone number as before.
$Me: Technology Service Desk, this is $StillStarvingAnswerIsStillNo, how can I help you?
$User: Hi. The code is not working. This is not working. I can't get it.
$Me (seeing that only 2 minutes have passed since we last spoke): Has $Security\_Director contacted you yet?
$Me: You need to wait for his call, he will help you resolve this issue
$User: No, You don't understand! I don't have the time! I can't wait! This needs to happen now! I tried to do it your way! I tried to give up my job to someone else! I'm **running out of time, i'm supposed to be grading these, sadkjlflasjdkf -** 
**$Me, interrupting:** $FirstName, I *do understand*, however, I can *not* give you another code to bypass the 2-factor authentication, for security reasons. I understand that you're having issues with $2FA, *that is why our security administrator will be calling you.* So, we can either work together to solve the problem, or I can end this call.
$Me: Alrighty then, now, he should be giving you a call momentarily, in the future, we can give you a keyfob if you're still having issues with the app or - 
$User: I NEED THIS FIXED NOW YOU AREN'T LISTENING! I NEED - 
And I hung up. 
That's the first time I've ever had to hang up on a caller that wasn't a telemarketer. I let $manager know, he understands and backs up my decision after I explain how the call went, and asks that I document what happened and email it to him. As I'm writing it up, my colleague's phone rings. It's $user. He politely declines to violate policy for her, and offers to fix the problem that she's having with $2FA. From what I was told, she was very polite and calm the whole time, and it turned out that she had blocked the number for $2FA, she had chosen "call me" as her preferred verification method, then proceeded to block that number. $Security\_Director called her while she was on the phone with my colleague. After they were finished, $Colleague came over to my desk.
A few minutes later, $CW1 came back from lunch.

throwaway because who wants this disaster on their mane account?
A little backstory, although not much is necessary, we're a typical couple (or we where)
We've been married for 5 years, both of indian descent, with dark skin to match.
we met in our workplace where we both still work together and have been (for the most part) happy ever since.
Things have been a little harder the last few years, we'd been trying for a baby for so long and started losing our hope. So when we finally got pregnant with a healthy baby boy, we where over the moon, my husband could not have been more excited to be a dad.
I'm avoiding it but, might as well cut to the chase, my baby is white. At first i didn't even really notice it, he was more red than anything, but once i saw it was like my brain split open right there in the hospital.
I can't entirly recall what happened, but my husband started screaming at me and i didnt even know what to say. of course i never cheated on him, but clear as day the baby is white! He stormed out pretty soon after, and has been at his brothers place ever since. i only know this because his brother texted me.
its been two days, he hasn't talked to me and I'm afraid to reach out, because i have nothing to even say. i understand why hes so angry, but it hurts that he would think I'd cheat, i cant help to be angry too.
I haven't been able to barley touch my baby, just looking at him makes me cry, its not his poor little fault but who's is? I'm not really a drinker, but i went to a couple events around the time i got pregnant, still i can't remember any moment i could have been drugged. did somone break into my house?
what if i never find out and my marriage is destroyed, if i can't fix this i don't know how i can take care of my son, i can't even look at him.
what do i do once i have to go back to work with him? Will i have to quit?
i dont even know what any of you can do but i feel like I'm drowning.
UPDATE: I'm still reading through all the responses, thank you so much. I had no idea i would get so much help and answers.

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>But one of the first tasks I was given was making new Cat5e patch cables for a particular server rack that was in dire need of reorganizing.</td><td>You haven't slipped yet, but if this keeps up, it *will* happen -- *most likely while your wife is away for 8 days and you're pissed off about it because you've let this friend whisper in your ear*.</td><td>This is not what "braided cable" is supposed to mean! Back when I was in high school, I got a part time job working as a data center technician for one of the companies at a colocation. Mostly I was doing various small tasks in maintaining lots of servers, as well as some basic office work (organizing old drawers, labeling stuff, etc.).
But one of the first tasks I was given was making new Cat5e patch cables for a particular server rack that was in dire need of reorganizing. Now, when I first saw this rack, I hadn't really seen what one of those is supposed to look like, but I knew that what I saw wasn't it.
They had something like 20 patch cables connecting these servers together, except someone decided to use 15-foot cables instead of the 1-3 foot ones that were actually needed.
So there were just lengths of cable danging all over this rack. Even worse, whoever did this chose to organize the cables by literally braiding them together. They could have used zip ties or something specifically for that purpose, but no, they used the cables themselves. There were at least 5 thick braids of twisted up cable hanging off of these servers.
It was like someone had heard about braided cables (what the inside of a single ethernet cable can look like), and decided to just make ethernet cable rope because it would look nicer. And it was my job to fix this mess.
Anyway, I ended up replacing all of these with much shorter cables, but unfortunately the old cables were permanently twisted and I'm not sure if they ever ended up using them for anything after that. I also later learned that these were the company's own servers, much unlike the pristine racks they kept for their clients.</td><td>This is the answer. OP, your feelings are valid -- you will be alone at Christmas, possibly for the first time since you got married, and your feelings of loss over your wife's father are no doubt strong, on top of your feelings over her plans to be away -- it sounds like FIL's love of Christmas was quite infectious. But her feelings are also valid -- that was *her daddy*. It is sad that you can't go, and you've let her know your feelings on that -- including not liking her response, and again, that's all valid. In a way, I feel like her response as you have reported it here ("suck it up and be a man", it seemed) was unnecessarily harsh on her part.
However, OP, you need to stop bring your family drama to this other female friend *NOW*. You haven't slipped yet, but if this keeps up, it *will* happen -- *most likely while your wife is away for 8 days and you're pissed off about it because you've let this friend whisper in your ear*. *You* are not the asshole -- **yet** -- but your female friend *is*.
**And under no circumstances should you spend any time with her over Christmas while your wife is away!!** Alone or otherwise.
Talk to your *wife* about the "suck it up" part, but don't be angry or accusative when you do it. Also, don't try to force anything with her, because that will drive her away, and don't worry about it becoming a yearly thing until it actually does -- as the saying goes, "don't borrow trouble."
*But for the love of all that is good and holy, OP, do not discuss this any further with your female friend!* It is none of her business, and it was inappropriate for you to bring any of this to her in the first place. Sure, it seemed natural at the time -- you've been friends for a long time, and maybe you thought you would get a "female perspective" -- but this interaction is the thin end of the wedge that has every possibility of destroying your marriage. And it would be *you* destroying it, not your wife partying in the Caribbean, as you fear.

* Top level comments must be the spoiler formatted description of a card revealed today. Any other top level comment will be removed. All discussion relating to these cards shall take place as a response to each top level comment.
* Discuss the revealed cards and their potential implications in competitive play. Karma grab or off-topic comments, as well as discussion about non-competitive Hearthstone should be reported/removed for discussion to be visible.
For those of you looking to catch up, here's the previous card discussion.
**Card text:** Your cards that summon minions summon twice as many.
* **Turncoat Contract:** Destroy a minion. It deals its damage to adjacent minions.
* New wording for Burgle effects - prevents the Thief Rogue mirror from being a feel-bad moment for either side. While previous Burgle cards will retain their original wording and functionality, future Burgle cards will use this new wording and yield non-Rogue class cards only.
**Card text:** After your hero attacks, shuffle a Bomb into your opponent's deck.
**Card text: Battlecry:** Shuffle a Bomb into your opponent's deck. When drawn, it explodes for 5 damage.
* Bomb Token
* As stated by Whalen on stream, this is the only neutral **Lackey** generator in the set.
#New Set Information
* Reveal Schedule
* **New Keyword - Twinspell:** When you cast a spell with Twinspell, it adds another copy of itself to your hand (but this time without Twinspell). So you can cast them twice in total. Unlike **Echo**, they don't have to be played during the same turn. 
* **New Mechanic – Schemes:** Scheme cards are spells that start off weak and grow stronger each turn they're in your hand, increasing a number on them each turn.
* **New Token Cards – Lackeys:** Because every evil mastermind needs a lackey! Lackeys are new Token cards. You can't put them into your decks, they are only generated by other *Rise of Shadows* cards. There are five Lackeys in total, one related to each of the villains. They are all 1 mana 1/1 minions with helpful **Battlecries**. As more villains join the League of EVIL throughout the year, more Lackeys will become available!
* **Callback Cards:** All of our villains have been around for quite a while, so some of the new cards might be familiar. Callback cards will be using mechanics from past expansions.

Concacaf rules so I included the Guianas as part of the Caribbean. 
I was inspired a while back by someone who was posting their collection of world coins on reddit. Not being a coin guy I looked into how difficult it was to get a coin from every nation. While I'm sure people who complete one coin from every country feel accomplished it doesn't seem terribly difficult so I wanted to step it up a notch.
I have been collecting silver bullion for decades. Some rounds, mostly bars never cared much for the coins. This little adventure has introduced me to a world where after 8 months of heavy studying I am still firmly an armature. I honestly thought one silver coin from every country this will take one or two months tops. 8 months later and I only have the Caribbean. 
I must say the coin world nearly turned me off in the beginning. Between the absolute dishonesty on eBay, they over the top fake machismo of coin shop dealers, and dealing with people selling their coins out of their basement online it's a different world if you're not prepared for it. 
But after I picked up a couple and did some research and saw some coins I really wanted I decided to stick with it. I can understand how this hobby can get very addictive and while I can stop at any time, I just don't want to yet. 
I set some rules for myself to guide my way. Must be denominational coins, no art rounds. I know most countries don't even make their coins anymore and some of these coins you can't spend in the host country but as a general rule no art bullion. I also wanted only whole denomination pieces. No quarters, nickels, or dimes except where I had to like Puerto Rico and US VI quarters. Ultimately I only averaged about $10 above spot per piece which I thought was pretty good considering how difficult and expensive some of the pieces got to be. I had to combine some Dutch Antilles territories because it was getting deep in the weeds and pricy with Bonair and Saba silver pieces.
Ultimately I had fun, I learned a lot. There's a lot of fun coins that I passed up that I wanted but I also had to stay focused to finish the region. I'm still more of a silver bullion guy though. As I spread this out it doesn't feel as impressive as a couple thick stack of bars. But I think I'll keep going. I'm sure there's some difficult roads ahead like African, Asia and South Pacific coins. But I can't wait to start researching and see what's out there.</td><td>0.0415199601551781</td><td>0.761757609778726</td><td>3</td></tr>

Sorry, this will take a while.
For Background:
Me (27M) and my Family are from Russia but moved to Germany when I was 8, and my parents have a lot of russian friends here, so we still have a lot of contact to russians. One friend of our family owns a pretty good russian restaurant. It's pretty big and well visited and on weekends there are even live musicians and a lot of dancing and so on. It's very nice and 200 people on a saturday is pretty normal for them. He called my mom once and asked if my sister (18 at the time) wanted to be waitress for this evening and earn a bit money. My sister was happy and said yes. But she had no car/license at the time and the restaurant was like 55km away, and my parents were out on that day, so my dad asked me if I would get her there and bring her back. I had no plans so I said yes, but since I dont wanted to bring her there and leave to come back 2-3 hours later to get her I decided to wait there. The restaurant is pretty classy, so it's pretty normal for guests to go there with their best clothes on. I didnt want to look weird so I put on my suit and bring her there. So, thats the background. Sorry for this long intro!
now to the main story: It was pretty full at this evening (250+guests i guess) and the Staff had a lot of work. Even the friend, who is the manager makes service and works nonstop. It's loud but very entertaining. As said, the staff was very busy and I didn't want to stand in their way so I stood aside and just enjoyed the music. The musicians do breaks sometimes and one of them, lets call him Alex, had a few minutes break and came to me for a little chat (it's super loud so we talk like in a club: how's work? what's new? had any dates lately?- stuff like that) There was a little couch we sat down as shared memes on the phones to each other and relaxing a bit. Suddenly, i feel a finger on my shoulder. Entering Karen... A woman in her 50s (blue fancy dress,  pearl necklace , a ton of make up and the typical Karen-haircut ) pointed at me and waved so I stand up and talk to her. Me: "Yea?" Karen: "Wow, if I would work like YOU do here, i shouldnt wonder to get fired. You just sit there and don't serve the food like the others!" I was shocked. The staff wears red vests with the restaurants name on the back and I was there in my usual black suit. "Sorry, what? I don't work h.." I got interrupted mid-sentence because Karen, took her flat hand and put it in my face and turned away moaning: "Don't you dare contradict me, streetdog! ( in russian there is a word for that, which is hard to translate but it means like "filthy, norights-creature" It's a very rude word) Me: "THE F?" She wents off to the bath rooms. Alex, who has seen it allm took my arm and said: "dude, the F? relax, lets go outside and take a smoke. You look like you'd explode any second!" Yes, I wanted to run after her and tell her a few things but I went outside and calmed down a bit. The manager came out and took a smokebreak too and asked me what's up. Alex told him the story and the Manager went crazy about it. HE apologized for a guests behavior. Now the surprise: A Guy standing outside nearby must have heard that and came right over: Guy:" The woman you are talking about: does she wear blue fancy dress, pearls etc.?" we:"yes" Guy looked pretty embarrassed. "That's my wife" We were all shocked. The Guy then apologized for his wife. He was completely ashamed. And went back in. We all started laughing. I enjoyed the rest of the music-acts and 2 hours later my sister and me went home. Still a funny story, when I think of the poor guy married to russian Karen.
Sorry for this insanely long story, but I hope you enjoyed it :) Have a nice day all :)</td><td>Not tax collectors, He had one as a close disciple, and had dinner at another one's house.

The author eventually clarifies that his envisioned "civil war" will not be a bloody battle, but his view of the stakes is still quite clear.
> The civil war I see is not the kind that would leave hundreds of thousands of young men dead in combat. That is not to say that we aren't seeing spats of violence but rather that this new war will be fought in courts, statehouses and ballot boxes, rather than in the fields.
And this war won't be only about the subjugation of Black people but also about the subjugation of all who challenge the white racist patriarchy.
I found this passage interesting as well:
> Can they make the case that all that the Constitution has not explicitly spelled out should be reserved for the states?
The author has pasted almost verbatim the 10th amendment and implies that the states are being novel or harmful in their belief that it exists.
Overall, I find this piece horribly distasteful and divisive. The author wants the NYT's liberal base to believe that conservatives take their inspiration from slaveholders and want to "subjugate" them. From a group that claims to deplore violent rhetoric, declaring war on the other side (or claiming the other side will wage war against you) seems unhelpful to the level of discourse.</td><td>0.041523904148284</td><td>0.7032938756011</td><td>3</td></tr>

To make policy based on the *statistical* trait of their sex was sexist. Women fought long and hard for the right to be judged based on *individual merit*, and sure enough many women can, and do, perform work that takes great strength. There are strong women and weak men.

Of course, Sir. Your wish is my command, Sir. TL;DR at the bottom. Not native in English, so apologies if something doesn't make sense.
I was just a customer, but hot damn.
I had a hotel room booked for two nights, from a 5 star well known hotel chain, that rhymes with Boliday Finn. Room was smallest/cheapest, with 2 double-beds, probably even located below parking garage. That was about only room available, so it would have to do.
About a month later, I arrive with my buddy to basically drop our stuff in the room, so we can take off right away, while the sun is still up. In the lobby, there is about 200 person group shouting all at once to the two ladies manning(?) the desk. After making plans for few minutes to store our stuff elsewhere, the desk attendant notices us, as we clearly were not part of the huge group, so she waves us over, past the large group, and starts to handle our check-in.
She politely asks us to fill the traveler forms while she's looking up my reservation. I thank her and try to make pleasant conversation about this and that, complementing their uniforms and the hotel, trying to improve the sour atmosphere the angry mob has been generating all around.
While we are filling the forms, angry man next to us, who was apparently the leader of the lobby-mob, keeps shouting, loud: "I demand that you arrange us extra room with two double-size beds! We had late addition to our travel, and they need a room with two double-size beds! RIGHT. F\*\*\*ING. NOW!"
Apparently, the arguing has been taking a place for quite a while already. She tries to get a word in, but gets interrupted: "I don't care if your stupid shit hotel is full, it's your job to give us place to sleep! Stupid woman. Get. Us. Another. Room! And double-size beds! Don't try anything else, I'm not interested of anything else! You idiot... I wonder how you can keep your job, if you can't even arrange a room for us."
Every time the main desk attendant tries to talk to the angry man, he rudely interrupts her, with more and more shouting. Only thing I can do, is to keep smiling at the ladies, sympathetically.
Him: "I don't want to hear! Just do your job and press the buttons to make it happen. You must be mentally slow, don't you? Two double beds, or is that too difficult for you?"
The clerks shares a tired look with each other, but suddenly both have this lamp lighting above their heads. They converse for a moment (using their native language) while pointing their screens and then proceeds to tell me: "Our apologies, Sir, but unfortunately we don't have your room with two double-beds available for you, which you had booked for. As you see, we are a bit full today." while she is gesturing to the mob in the lobby.
My heart sinks a bit, until she continues: "So, because we are fully booked, only room we can offer to you, is the executive suite at the 24th floor, obviously for no extra cost. Unfortunately, it doesn't have two double-size beds..."
She takes eye contact with the angry man and continues: "...but it has 4 king size beds. Each in their own en-suites."
Angry man drops dead silent and is just staring at us. His mouth just moves like of a mouth of a fish, who is stranded on a dry land.
While looking at me again, she continues: "I hope you accept the free room upgrade, with our most sincere apologies in behalf of the hotel management. And of course all the room service is free, including the refreshments available in the suite kitchen and suite bar areas, and all hotel VIP facilities are in your disposal 24/7. Please do enjoy your stay and let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable."
She dings a small bell and piccolo takes our bags while gesturing towards the fancy separate elevator at the side. I'm so shocked that I can mutter only a little bit of thanks and follow the piccolo.
While we are making our way towards the elevator, the main-desk is explaining to the angry man: "Sir, I'm happy to inform you that we were able to make arrangements to have single room with two double-size beds, available to accommodate your extra guests. That will be 199€ added to your bill."
She now has much more commanding tone, and she responds: "Unfortunately, Sir, our 'free executive suite' is not available. It is booked now. I tried to offer you king-size, but you were having none of it. So will you take the single room or not?"
I can't tell accurately what was said next, but I'm quite sure it is lots of cursing and throwing more insults from the man (using the man's native language). All I have is this shit-eating grin while the bell-hop closes the elevator doors, taking us up.
Maybe half an hour later when we head out to check the city, the lobby has been cleared. We go to the desk to thank the two attendants and give them both good tip, that we easily save with the free room service, over the expensive hotel restaurant. Unfortunately, our schedule doesn't allow us to enjoy the free hotel VIP services much, but the ladies definitely earn a little bit of extra.
It was great experience for us and I still remember this clearly, after a long time. That front desk girl... she was truly maliciously compliant with the angry man.
TL;DR: Angry man wants extra room with two double beds, from a full hotel, and accepts nothing else. I get upgraded free to executive suite with all the benefits, so hotel can accommodate the angry man in the broom closet that I had booked, matching his required parameters for the small bed-type.
To add: The executive suite was absolutely fantastic. Only downside was that I would have needed to bring my own helicopter to use the helipad on the roof, to fully enjoy the privileges included to the room. /s
Also, there was 3 bowls in my toilet: a regular one, a bidet to wash my arse after using the first one and third one was something that I still don't know what it was or how to use it. I was just standing there, my arse squeaking clean, staring the third bowl and thinking: "Is this some sort of a rich joke that I'm too peasant to understand?"
EDIT: Thank you for the gold, mysterious stranger!
Second stranger gets ^(a little bit smaller) thanks for the silver too!
Also, Piccolo = Bellhop / Bell-boy. No idea why my brain give me this word to use in the text. Bad brain, bad.</td><td>Trust me: the internet knows your IP address. The internet *must* know your IP address, in order for it to be able to send you the data that you request when you pull up a web page or fetch your email. If the internet *didn't* know your IP address, you won't get any cat videos.
Furthermore, "your" IP address *doesn't belong to you*, plus it changes periodically. It belongs to the ISP that you get your internet service from; they just lease it out to you.
So, what you want to do is use a dynamic DNS service, or DDNS, something like No-IP or Dyn. You'll set up an account with one of those services, pick a domain name, then run a small program on your server which will update that domain name with the IP address currently assigned to your router (it's likely that your router has the capability built into it, so you wouldn't need to install anything anywhere else). Also, forward the ports in your router necessary for them to connect to your Minecraft server.
Now, you just tell your Minecraft friends to connect to your server at myminecraftserver.dynamicdnsservice.tld (don't use that, because it's fake; replace it with your actual dynamic domain name). They can technically still get your IP address, but *that doesn't matter*. And at this point, all they could do with the IP address is exactly what they can do with your DDNS domain name: connect to your Minecraft server, and maybe run a port scan, which at this point would only show the Minecraft server.
BTW, having an IP address *does not* give anyone your exact location. The *best* it can do is show that you use a specific ISP and are located somewhere within a couple hundred square miles of the address on record for that ISP's local office. And for some ISPs, they don't associate IP addresses with specific office locations, so your IP address might locate you to a spot thousands of miles away from your actual geographical location, i.e. the headquarters office of the ISP.</td><td>0.0415278897899888</td><td>0.7210475784483769</td><td>3</td></tr>

All right, let's get a supervisor involved and see how that goes for you. I work at a hospital that doubles as a research institution. Since I'm on the research side, I have to involve lots of other departments, and most people with whom I work with are very chill and understand that I have to beseech them for things to do my job. I'm one of those "she can go a hundred hectares on a single tank of kerosene" type of people, and I'm very on top of things, for which my coworkers value me. However, the one place where that camaraderie breaks down is with \[some of\] the nurses who work in my specific clinic (focusing on one particular disease).  
  
Honestly, I've done a good job making most of the nurses like me. I bring them homemade treats sometimes, and I'm always extra friendly and approbative with them. Some of them have their days regardless, and I put up with them.  
  
Right after I first started working in that specific clinic, unfortunately, one nurse in particular (let's call her Bitchelle) had decided that I was on her blacklist. Bitchelle hates doing work. She's like a kid playing Xbox when their parent asks them for help with groceries. She'll moan and groan, and if she helps at all, it's with an angsty indignation.  
  
I needed a series of blood tubes drawn in clinic for a patient one morning (instead of down in phlebotomy -- protocol rules -- more complicated and stupid than it's worth getting into here), and Bitchelle was the only nurse available. She was extremely put off at my asking her to draw this protocol kit (despite my giving advance notice to clinic that this needed to be done). She clearly did not want to leave her computer (which was not open to anything work-related), but she begrudgingly went and drew the tubes. She was unnecessarily profusely thanked by me... just for doing her damn job.  
  
I came back down later to get a prescription signed for another patient, and a different nurse asked me what I'd done to upset Bitchelle because she'd apparently been going off about me to anyone who would listen. I explained what had happened. The other nurse informed me that Biptchelle was pissed at me, and also felt my outfit -- a white medical coat, a modest blouse, work pants, and high heel boots -- was too provocative. What? I just decided to let it go and try to avoid Bitchelle as much as possible.  
  
This did not work. I kept running into situations where the other nurses were busy seeing patients. I was forced to walk back into the nurse triage room -- which is off-limits to patients -- and ask Bitchelle to draw two more of these blood kits in the next month. She was never happy to see me, and she was always wasting time on her work computer when I entered the room.  
  
Maybe 2 or 3 days after that last kit draw, my supervisor called me in her office to discuss my "presentation". She very nicely, and with pity in her voice, told me she'd received a report about my dress habits in patient-facing spaces. She said she personally hadn't noticed anything (no shit), but was obligated to discuss this with me anyhow. I assured her I had no idea what she was talking about. I thought about confronting Bitchelle, but decided not to because, ya know. Loose cannon and whatnot. After a brief reminder of the dress code, I figured that at least it was over.  
  
It was not over. Two weeks later -- and I hadn't even asked anyone to draw any kits in the interim -- a formal report was filed against me for my conduct in clinic. This went to the hospital and then my supervisor who, even after reading the report, seemed totally clueless about what it could mean. I explained what had been happening with Bitchelle.  
  
But then my supervisor told me a second person had reported this as well, on the same day as who was obviously Bitchelle. This time, it was a patient. The patient had reported that I was dressing improperly for a patient-facing environment. Woah woah woah woah. I asserted that I wasn't, but I was nonetheless put on probation, which meant that my supervisor, against her will, now had to come with me when I saw patients in clinic for the foreseeable future, and a nurse manager would have to accompany both of us when she was free since I was "dressing provocatively" in patient-facing spaces and that was her domain.  
  
But as you can likely guess from her browsing habits, Bitchelle was not the sort of person who needed MORE supervisors in her area.  
  
Cue malicious compliance. Fine, you want to punish me and force me to work in the eyesight of the supervisors? All right, let's get some supervisors down here as quickly as possible.  
My next in-clinic patient came in two days, and it was one of those stupid timed-in-clinic protocol kit visits, which meant I was forced to ask one of the nurses to draw the patient's blood. I informed my supervisor and we set off down for clinic. The nurse manager was in that day, so she accompanied the two of us.  
  
We all went back into the triage room so that I could ask for help with the blood draw. Bitchelle and one other nurse were there. What we saw upon entering was the other nurse entering vital signs for a patient into our health database, and Bitchelle... sitting at her desk with an online clothing retailer open on one monitor, and Facebook on the other.  
  
I asked for Bitchelle's help drawing the kit, and she sighed heavily and spun around... to see two higher-ups looking on with disdain at her work computer. In embarrassment, she swiveled back and closed those two tabs, which revealed — you can't make this stuff up — a website for MARITAL AIDS that had been open in another tab, about which Bitchelle had clearly forgotten until now. I just smiled and handed her the bag like nothing had happened.  
  
In the hall, my supervisor and the nurse manager were talking about Bitchelle's display just now. Apparently, she had been previously been warned about goofing off at work. The nurse manager told the supervisor that she was going to check all of Bitchelle's work computer activity, which I actually didn't know any supervisor could readily access.  
  
What followed was so incredibly beautiful that I hope it made the ending of this long, long post worth waiting for.  
  
According to the nurse who'd initially asked me what I had done to upset Bitchelle, her activity was searched. She was revealed to have been spending hours upon hours every day browsing the web, shopping, and using social media. Since she had been previously warned about this behavior, she was given a formal write-up.  
  
But this was just the beginning. The day after the three of us went down to clinic, my supervisor called me in her office again. She told me that Bitchelle had FABRICATED the patient complaint about me and posted it from her work computer. (How did they learn this? Oh, that'd be because she saved a draft of the message that reported me to the hospital, and she'd accessed the patient complaint/comment webpage the same day.) My supervisor sincerely apologized for the hassle and told me I was no longer on probation.  
  
As for Bitchelle: apparently fearing the worst, she put her two weeks' notice in the same day after getting wind that she was in some far more serious trouble. For reasons I will never understand as long as I live, the hospital chose to let her quit after 2 weeks instead of firing her on the spot. Maybe they knew what a nightmare she was and were comfortable letting her quit on her own accord. It's not as though she was due to glean any glowing references from this experience. Maybe they just wanted some extra work — our clinic was VERY short-staffed for nurses at the time. In any case, they chose not to fire her and let her quit on her own.  
  
On Bitchelle's last day, I ventured down to the triage room to retrieve some outside records from their printer. When I entered, Bitchelle was alone and browsing Glassdoor. I unbuttoned my white coat and told her, "Hey, good luck with your next job. I hope the employees are less provocative." She slowly spun around with a scowl on her face. Then I lifted my dress up to my neck, flashed her my bare tits, and walked out, and I never saw Bitchelle again.  
  
TL;DR setup: I run drug trials at a research hospital. A clinic nurse decided she hated me because I made her do her job and, she claimed, "dressed provocatively". She made a formal report against me, and then a patient one surfaced. I was put on probation and made to see all patients with supervisors.  
  
TL;DR resolution/malicious compliance: I brought supervisors down as quickly as possible. Said supervisors found out the nurse had been spending many hours a day on non-work related websites, and the patient report against me turned out to have been fabricated by the same nurse. She quit in disgrace, and on her last day, I gave her a nice parting gift.</td><td>Your "home IP" is always exposed, otherwise devices at home could never access any resource on the internet, ever.

First,  remove all Intel Pentium and Celeron computer processor chips from  personal computers (desktops, laptops and notebooks) as these were  either developed or manufactured in Israel.
Note that the  revolutionary new Ivy Bridge processor will be manufactured in  Israel. Any computers running the Windows XT operating system must be  turned off immediately as this was developed in Israel. All current  Microsoft operating systems are not to be used as Microsoft is heavily  reliant on its Israel R&D centre.
**Step 2**.  Any computers that still work need to have their anti-virus software  and personal firewalls removed as this technology originated in Israel.  The organisation's firewall will also need to be switched off. Staff  should no longer open external emails as most of these will be infected  with viruses. No outgoing emails can be sent. The algorithm (code)  that's used today for sending e-mails, was made by an Israeli who worked  at the Ben-Gurion University in Be'er-Sheva in 1980.
**Step 3**.  Discard all mobile phones, as this technology was developed in Israel,  where the first mobile phones were manufactured. Mobile chip technology  from a single Israeli company has now been installed in over 100 million  devices. Only top-level staff may retain mobile phones for emergency  situations. However the use of SMS (Texting) is expressly forbidden as  this facility was developed in Israel. No 4G devices can be used, as the  chipset is Israeli.
**Step 4**. Turn off  your voice-mail service and delete any recorded messages. Israeli  companies invented the voice-mail system. If someone you do not know  answers your phone-call, then hang up. Israeli call-centres and  call-centre technology is in widespread operation in the UK.
**Step 5**.  Before accepting any printed material, check that the supplier has not  used the Israeli device that might have saved up to 50% of the ink used.
**Step 6**.  At home, do not use Facebook as many in-built and add-on applications  are Israeli-developed. Do not watch videos on the Internet as the  platform used to upload them may be from AOL and hence from an Israeli  company. Do not use the Internet to search for answers to your questions  as this may involve use of an Israeli-developed search engine. Better  to remain unenlightened.
**Step 7**. On your  TV or home entertainment centre, do not use Video On Demand (VOD) to  watch movies as you may inadvertently see an advert displayed  using Israeli software. Do not purchase any games devices as these are  likely to use Israeli technology.
**Step 8**.  Do not read books using an e-book as this may contain Israeli  technology. Do not use data storage as it may have been developed at  Israel's storage technology R&D center.
**Step 9**.  Do not buy an electric car as it is likely to be powered with  an Israeli battery or use Israeli developed charging mats. Continue to  sit in traffic knowing that you are polluting the environment and  financing oil-rich despotic regimes.
Turning to  food and drink, all food outlets on the organisation's premises must  dispose of cherry tomatoes, which were developed in Israel. Staff must  ensure that no cherry tomatoes are included in sandwiches brought into  office premises. The ban also applies to honey and any products derived  from honey. Israel has developed solutions to the worldwide problem of  bee-colony collapse, so that any products derived from bees might only  be available now due to an Israeli invention.
Avoid  drinking any of the world-recognized award-winning Israeli wines. Do not  consume homemade drinks from Israeli-manufactured household drinks  machines.
Avoid any fruit from South Africa or Peru as produce from these countries is being marketed with Israeli brand names.
No  agricultural products from the following areas must be consumed as they  use water irrigation and agricultural technology provided directly from  Israel. This includes most of Africa, China, India, Indonesia (a Muslim  country), Nepal and many others.
Much fruit and  vegetables (including organic) imported into the UK has been enhanced  using Israeli technology. This may save millions of people from starving  around the world, but is not a good reason for you to eat it. To be  safe, only eat fruit and vegetables that you have grown yourself using  seeds that have been in your family for generations.
Destroy  all personal medication. Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals, the largest  generic drugs company in the world, will have manufactured many of your  medicines.  Staff with the following illnesses will need to take  specific precautions.
Cancer – do not take any form of  medication or treatment. Israeli scientists have been working at the  forefront of oncology for decades.
AIDS and HIV – beware;  researchers at Israel's Weizmann Institute or Hebrew University  developed or improved AZT and Hypericin-based drugs; they have also  developed a treatment that destroys HIV-infected cells without damaging  healthy ones.
Diabetes – do not measure or inject Insulin using the devices developed by Israeli scientists.
Multiple  Sclerosis – stop taking Copaxone, one of the most efficient medicines  and the only non-interferon agent, as Teva developed it.  Don't  touch Laquinimod either.
Parkinson's – remove the  Israel-pioneered brain pacemaker to stop tremors. Discontinue Levodopa,  which reduces motor disturbances. Cease sessions that involve magnetic  cortex stimulation.
Staff with a family history of heart  disease and arteriosclerosis must not use the Israeli device for early  detection of these.  Rather, wait until onset of the disease.
Epileptics  – stop treatment that may have benefited from the Israeli discovery of  the underlying mutant gene; also throw away the bracelet that sends out  an alert when a person goes into seizure.
Staff or relatives with Age-related Macular Degeneration – remove Israeli implants that arrest the disease.
Liver disease – abandon Israeli-developed antibody immunotherapy treatments.
Emphysema – steer clear of the Israeli protein replacement therapy.
Myeloma – stop taking the drug Velcade, which was developed over a period of 30 years by scientists at Haifa.
Sleep apnea – no tests using the breakthrough Israeli device for diagnosis.
Dyslexics must not benefit from the Israeli Internet-based reading system.
Skin allergies must be treated with steroid creams only, as the new safer non-steroid alternative is Israeli.
Any  incident of stroke or head trauma or onset of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,  MS, epilepsy, glaucoma or brain tumor must avoid using any of the  Weizmann Institute's patented methods of treatment.
Before  any surgery or medical tests, check that hospital catheters have not  been protected from infection using the new plastic from Israel that  disables microorganisms. Avoid throat surgery as this may utilize  Israeli surgical lasers.
Ensure any colonoscopy or gastro  investigation does not use internal Israeli cameras such as the  Pillcam.  Never undergo surgery to install an artificial heart, as the  first artificial heart transplant took place in Israel.
Kidney  transplant patients must wait for donors of the same blood group as  only Israel's revolutionary new methods allow donors from other blood  groups.  Staff of Arab origin must not make use of the only database for  matching potential Arab donors of bone-marrow – in Israel.
In  the event of a spinal injury or disease, do not accept spinal  implants – likely to be an Israeli product or development. Heart rhythm  problems must not be solved with the Israeli-developed heart pulse  generator. All heart stents are off-limits as most of these originate  from Israeli medical companies.
Check all vaccines as many  of these have been developed in Israel.  Ensure that all X-rays do  carry a radiation risk, as the only radiation-free system is  Israeli.  Treatments derived from Stem Cell research must be avoided  as most of these are Israeli-developed.
If you or your  family are struck with a bacterial infection, do not take alternatives  to older, ineffective bacteria-resistant antibiotics, as an  Israeli discovery will have been responsible for the modern, effective  drugs. Check that any pain relief medication is not based on soya as an  Israeli doctor discovered the beneficial effect of the soya bean.
Do  not use the revolutionary new Israeli bandage that saved the life of  Arizona senator Gabriella Giffords after she was shot in the head.  If  you break a bone badly, reject any treatment that involves introducing  collagen, as this may have been manufactured from Israeli plants.
Do not protect babies and infants from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome with the Babysense system from Israel.
Do not use Epilady (or epilator) – two Israelis invented this hair removal device.
Finally, reject all major dental treatment, as your teeth may need to be scanned with an Israeli-developed dental scanner.
When  interviewing prospective new staff or holding meetings with members of  the public or with individuals from other companies, it is vital that  you check whether they originate from, or are associated with the  following countries and areas. You must ensure that you do not have any  contact with people who have benefited from Israel's aid to those  countries. The organization must avoid any possible acknowledgment of  Israel's contribution to world relief.   In addition, you must obtain a  formal statement from the government of these countries that Israeli aid  was not responsible for the production or development of any goods and  services supplied to the organization.

Peru's hydro-electric power plants are also being built and run by an Israeli company.
Rawanda, Mexico, Chad,  Sudan (Darfur) and Malawi all have received humanitarian aid from  Israel, including medical assistance from Israel's NGO IsraAID.
Always  remember that the boycott extends to any individuals from the above  regions that have been exposed to Israeli assistance during the 63 years  existence of the current Jewish State.
\-Reject  all products from the USA. Analysis conducted in a typical US  stateshows that Israeli innovations were responsible for $2.4 billion in  direct revenue to that state's economy in 2009 and generated nearly  6,000 jobs.
\-Do not tutor your children in advanced  Mathematics techniques, which may have originated in Israel. Also, if  these techniques are used in your children's schools, withdraw your  children immediately.
\-Keen ornithologists should consider  giving up their hobby as many rarespecies stop off or reside in Israel  during their twice-yearly migration.
\-Do not watch the new series of NCIS as one of the actresses is Israeli.
\-Avoid going to any football matches featuring teams with Israeli players.
\-Destroy  all your recordings of Madonna, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Deep  Purple, Bon Jovie, Justin Bieber, George Benson, Moby and many, many  more artists who have ridiculed the illogical boycott and have proudly  performed (or will shortly perform) concerts in Israel.
\-Destroy  any recordings of U2, Lady Gaga, Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, Beck,  Rihanna Coldplay and any artist whose music has been recorded using  the sound technology of the Grammy Award winning Israeli company Wave  Audio. You also must get rid of any personal copies of *Shrek*,*American Beauty* and *Star Wars*. Do not trust anything recorded by Sony, JVC, Toshiba or Dell.
\-Don't go to see *The Black Swan* with Natalie Portman, or watch any old films with Elizabeth Taylor – both lovers of the Jewish State.
\-Do not stay in hotels or visit shopping centers owned by Israeli companies (sorry, you will need to check which ones yourself).
\-Do not have anything to do with the banks who are using Israeli software to prevent fraud.
\-Do  not use any credit or debit card as the Security monitoring system used  by the credit card companies is likely to be Israeli.
\-Do not buy an engagement ring containing a diamond as it is possible that this may have been cut in Israel.
\-Do not travel by air, as your plane might get towed by the Israeli-built "Taxibot."
\-Do not use public transport inside Amsterdam, Moscow or Northern Chinain case you benefit from Israeli transportation devices.
\-If  you suffer a power or network failure, be grateful that at least you  haven't installed the Israeli system that prevents power outages.
\-Finally,  you need to leave all your taps running when you leave home and must  never flush your  toilet, because Israel provides water-saving technology to over half of  the planet. It also is providing sewage treatment technology across the  world, including to the UK. It should be obvious by now that all the  measures specified in Parts 1 – 4 of this series of blogs will  inevitably mean that your organization and your staff will be completely  unable to function.  Let's therefore hope that the decision by your  organization to boycott Israeli products is flushed down the toilet of  history.

From  1966 onward Coca-Cola has been a  staunch supporter of Israel. Recently  the Government of Israel Economic  Mission honored Coca-Cola at the  Israel Trade Award Dinner for its  continued support of Israel for the  last 30 years and for refusing to  abide by the Arab League boycott of  Israel.
NESTLE
Swiss food giant Nestle will set up a   global research and development center for snack foods next year in   Sderot, a town in Israel's Negev desert, the Maariv newspaper reported   on Sunday. Nestle owns 50.1 percent of Israeli food maker Osem   Investments and the two together produce snack foods at a plant in   Sderot.
DISNEY
The Disney Company is owned by Jewish  Mogul  Michael Eisner. He owns a vast media empire that includes the  ABC  television network, numerous news dailies, national magazines,  Hollywood  film companies and a large number of radio stations. One  radio station  in Los Angeles, KABC 790 AM recently broadcast comments  by Jewess Gloria  Alred to the effect that the Islamic prisoners at  Guantanamo should be  tortured by having their "balls" extracted with  pliers in order to make  them talk. The news and commentaries made  through Michael Eisner's media  octopus are extremely Islamophobic and  anti-Palestinian.
KIMBERLY-CLARK
In 1998 Mr. Robert  P. Van der Merwe,  chairman of Kimberly-Clark Europe received the  Jubilee Award by the  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. This is the  highest tribute ever  awarded by the "State of Israel" in recognition of  those individuals and  organizations, that through their investments  and trade relationships,  have done the most to strengthen the Israeli  economy.

Sorry, this will take a while.
For Background:
Me (27M) and my Family are from Russia but moved to Germany when I was 8, and my parents have a lot of russian friends here, so we still have a lot of contact to russians. One friend of our family owns a pretty good russian restaurant. It's pretty big and well visited and on weekends there are even live musicians and a lot of dancing and so on. It's very nice and 200 people on a saturday is pretty normal for them. He called my mom once and asked if my sister (18 at the time) wanted to be waitress for this evening and earn a bit money. My sister was happy and said yes. But she had no car/license at the time and the restaurant was like 55km away, and my parents were out on that day, so my dad asked me if I would get her there and bring her back. I had no plans so I said yes, but since I dont wanted to bring her there and leave to come back 2-3 hours later to get her I decided to wait there. The restaurant is pretty classy, so it's pretty normal for guests to go there with their best clothes on. I didnt want to look weird so I put on my suit and bring her there. So, thats the background. Sorry for this long intro!
now to the main story: It was pretty full at this evening (250+guests i guess) and the Staff had a lot of work. Even the friend, who is the manager makes service and works nonstop. It's loud but very entertaining. As said, the staff was very busy and I didn't want to stand in their way so I stood aside and just enjoyed the music. The musicians do breaks sometimes and one of them, lets call him Alex, had a few minutes break and came to me for a little chat (it's super loud so we talk like in a club: how's work? what's new? had any dates lately?- stuff like that) There was a little couch we sat down as shared memes on the phones to each other and relaxing a bit. Suddenly, i feel a finger on my shoulder. Entering Karen... A woman in her 50s (blue fancy dress,  pearl necklace , a ton of make up and the typical Karen-haircut ) pointed at me and waved so I stand up and talk to her. Me: "Yea?" Karen: "Wow, if I would work like YOU do here, i shouldnt wonder to get fired. You just sit there and don't serve the food like the others!" I was shocked. The staff wears red vests with the restaurants name on the back and I was there in my usual black suit. "Sorry, what? I don't work h.." I got interrupted mid-sentence because Karen, took her flat hand and put it in my face and turned away moaning: "Don't you dare contradict me, streetdog! ( in russian there is a word for that, which is hard to translate but it means like "filthy, norights-creature" It's a very rude word) Me: "THE F?" She wents off to the bath rooms. Alex, who has seen it allm took my arm and said: "dude, the F? relax, lets go outside and take a smoke. You look like you'd explode any second!" Yes, I wanted to run after her and tell her a few things but I went outside and calmed down a bit. The manager came out and took a smokebreak too and asked me what's up. Alex told him the story and the Manager went crazy about it. HE apologized for a guests behavior. Now the surprise: A Guy standing outside nearby must have heard that and came right over: Guy:" The woman you are talking about: does she wear blue fancy dress, pearls etc.?" we:"yes" Guy looked pretty embarrassed. "That's my wife" We were all shocked. The Guy then apologized for his wife. He was completely ashamed. And went back in. We all started laughing. I enjoyed the rest of the music-acts and 2 hours later my sister and me went home. Still a funny story, when I think of the poor guy married to russian Karen.
Sorry for this insanely long story, but I hope you enjoyed it :) Have a nice day all :)</td><td>A lot of times, it isn't *actual* upper-middle-class people, but *wannabe* upper-middle-class people, a.k.a. karens, who inhabit HOA boards.

So i hear behind me the following conversation:
(At this, i figure they know each other and that it is a normal convo)
M1: I can't find the chips I like, it looks like they are out, I can't remember the brand name.

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>An 11-1 Notre Dame that year would've put on equal footing with fellow one-loss non-champs Florida, Oregon, and whoooole bunch of two-loss SEC teams.</td><td>He explains Price could actually prevent Judge McCannon from working on criminal cases because of California Code of Civil Procedure 170.</td><td>If the proposed 12-team playoff rules were in effect in 2018, you can make a strong case that Notre Dame should've just played its scout team against USC. For those who forget, here was the playoff picture going into rivalry week of 2018:
Some relevant notes:
* Alabama, Georgia, Clemson and #24 Pittsburgh had clinched their divisions.
* The winner of OU/WVU would play Texas in the Big 12 championship (I can't remember if Texas had actually clinched at this point, but in any case they would've had to have lost to Kansas).
* The winner of the Apple Cup would play #18 Utah in the Pac-12 championship.
* Michigan/OSU would play #19 Northwestern in the Big Ten championship.
* ND had ranked wins against Michigan, Pittsburgh, Northwestern, and #20 Syracuse. (At this point they were actually #1 in Strength of Record)
In real life, ND was playing to maintain a playoff bid. But what's amusing is if the proposed system was in place then, **there's very little changes in terms of the playoff race if they take a loss**.
In terms of making the playoffs, their ticket is already punched. If they enter the final rankings 12-0, no matter what else happens, they'll get the fifth seed. But if they enter the final rankings 11-1, it's highly likely they'll *still* get the fifth seed. But more importantly, it's nearly impossible to draw up a situation where they finish worse than the #8 seed, maintaining their homefield advantage.
Taking it conference by conference, how would each conference match up to an 11-1 ND?
* **Big Ten:** The loser of OSU/Michigan takes a second loss. The winner either takes a second loss in the championship or clinches a bye. Penn State really doesn't threaten to pass ND.
* **Big 12:** OU winning out would clinch the bye, them losing at some point gets them to two losses. Texas and WVU can't threaten to pass ND.
* **SEC:** The only likely outcome that displaces ND as the 5th seed is that Bama beats Auburn and then loses to Georgia in the championship game. Non-champ Georgia and LSU would have two losses. Florida and Kentucky don't seriously threaten to overtake ND.
* **ACC:** The first thing to keep in mind here is Clemson entered the ACC championship game 28-point favorites, so from the perspective of ND, they can basically count on Clemson taking one of the byes. But the other thing is even *if* Clemson were shocked in championship game, it'd be to a Pittsburgh team ND already beat. Combined with the fact that Clemson also barely beat Syracuse while ND had obliterated them, it's highly likely they would fall behind ND.
* **PAC-12**: Utah and Washington can't jump ND in the rankings. The other likely option that could lose ND the 5th seed is Wazzou winning out and being the obvious fifth man out compared to OU, Bama, Clemson, and OSU/Michigan. But while it's close, my guess is that ND would still be ranked above a one-loss Wazzou given the general weakness of their resume and the general tenor of 
* **American**: UCF was completely disrespected by the committee this season. Even going undefeated, they wouldn't have jumped ND. In real life they didn't even jump 10-2 Michigan.
So from the perspective of ND, there's actually not much to lose in playing your scout team against USC and letting them get obliterated, while giving your starters a two-week bye before the playoffs.
Some objections:
But pride aside, no, they wouldn't. For one thing, there's all sorts of incentive structures built into coaches' salaries that would discourage this. This post is strictly for entertainment purposes. (And yes, to highlight the fact that while the new rules maintain the significance of conference championship game, it does diminish the regular season on occasion.)
***Would Notre Dame players and fans*** **really** ***be okay with throwing a game to USC in particular?*** Idk, I think it would be an amusing amount of disrespect. But there is something to the idea that we don't have to worry about people throwing regular season games because the final game is always rivalry week. But would fans throw a fit if ND tanked down the road against a bad Stanford team, or BYU against some random Mountain West? ehhhhh....
***Don't the advantages of playing the 12th seed make it worth locking in a 5th seed rather than risking a slide?*** In some years, yes, if for example there was a high change that some mediocre G5 conference champion ranked around #24 in the AP would sneak in. But in 2018 it looked like the #12 seed would actually *be* a top 12 team (with UCF set to cruise to a top ten ranking), and there's just not a whole lot of difference between the #11 and #12 teams in the country. But again, the bigger question is not if there's any advantages to playing #12 over #11, but whether the chance of losing that advantage outweighs the guaranteed advantage of taking a bye week. And arguably, you should take the bye week.
***Wouldn't locking in the #5 seed be worth it when it comes to seeding for the quarterfinals, and then the finals?*** Again, possibly some years, but the #1 and #2 seeds were highly likely to be Alabama and Clemson, and the #3 and #4 seed were highly likely to be the Big Ten and Big 12 champs. There was a BIG step from 1-2 to 3-4, but just not a lot of difference between #3 and #4 teams.
***Should ND have done the same in 2012 when they were the #1 team in the country?*** No, because the breakdown of teams was different. An 11-1 Notre Dame that year would've put on equal footing with fellow one-loss non-champs Florida, Oregon, and whoooole bunch of two-loss SEC teams. Given the closeness of their wins in other games, it was by no means certain they'd maintain a homefield advantage.
***Isn't there a chance that ND loses to USC so badly, they slip to #9 or below?*** The committee takes a lot of factors into account when ranking teams, and I'm assuming "every single one of our starters and backups didn't play" would be taken to account.
***Isn't there a chance that the committee gets really pissed at ND tanking and slots them in at #9 as a fuck you?*** Yeah, this is the biggest practical hurdle. I'm operating on the assumption that they approach the matter fairly, but no one would blame them for making an example of ND.
***Any final thoughts?*** Well my biased take is that they should tie the first round byes to rankings. But another possible way to prevent this scenario would be to tie byes to championships, but *homefield advantage* to rankings. So for example, in 2018, a top four ND gets bumped down to #5 seed and plays the #12 seed. But in the next round, when it comes time to play #4 seed (but 6th ranked) Ohio State, the game happens in South Bend.</td><td>Stop electing radical DAs.

My work environment is less an environment and more-so a conglomeration of duct tape, spit, and cussing. I managed, among many things, a set of rentals, accounts receivable, and customer database analysis. Essentially, our company's bus factor was far too ~~high~~low.
Another important bit that I handled were various legal documents that the State requires meticulous processes to be followed, and allows for a digital or physical paper trail. I opted for digital.
Now, my boss kindly provided me a Pentium 4 dual core computer that he found at the bargain warehouse for about $40. I had the most sophisticated work station in the business, for context. This wasn't quite enough for database management and analytical software to boot up - more or less process a dataset, so I called up our IT guy.  Who worked for the boss's friend's sister-in-law's business. 200 miles away. I go, "Hey Tim! I need to add my personal laptop to the company network. Can you make that happen?"
"Sure, I'll be down to that location in a week or two. Can it wait?"
So Tim shows up. We get the boss to rubber stamp that this is all OK, and I have remote access to the servers and some annoying corporate* mandated securities on my laptop. Which, no big deal, they stay out of the way.
We didn't have anything like a software policy, either. I think some computers had Office 2007 installed, but that's clunky and makes data transfer complicated. It's the 20 teens, there's no need for that.
I do all of my work on a google drive account tied to my work email. This is great, because I can hot-swap my work station to wherever the boss wants me today. Sometimes he likes to pretend I'm a secretary and throws me in his office. Sometimes he thinks I'm a technician and puts me at a station with no computer. Whatever. Data is transient. 
Anyways. Things have been tense recently. I've moved almost all of my job to digital, and the boss thinks that means I don't work any more. Obviously, an office monkey with no papers is an office monkey with not enough work. Now, he wasn't EXACTLY wrong. I had been automating things, and was doing the job of about 6 people.
How can I do the job of 6 people without the boss knowing? Easy. He likes to manage by the seat of his pants. One day he fired a maintenance person and just "rolled" that job into the receptionist, driver, and technician jobs. One day he decided that the sales team could handle marketing - surely buying a single $2000 camera is cheaper than having a professional do shoots each week. Besides - guerilla handicam sales pitches are in vogue, it'll be great! 
Moving on, after two years of "shuffling" I had accumulated a large amount of jobs. Many of them tedious. And, with the right tools (made by me, at home, on my personal laptop that happens to be able to connect to the network), a good 4 hour job can be completed with about 10 minutes of sorting and parsing data. 
So the time comes. We all know its coming - one of the suits tipped me off that the particular suit who's payroll is wasted on chumps like me had propositioned the boss that a pair of receptionists can do the work I do, for cheaper. Just hire some college kids, work 'em each 18 hours a week, it'll be grand.
Knowing that, I backed up everything to my personal google.drive account - but of course did not delete anything from the company owned one. Like I said, the State has a vested interest in these processes, and I knew in my heart-of-hearts that the company couldn't be trusted to maintain records. I didn't want to be on the hook for that in 6 years, so I kept a copy.
I figured it would go smoothly. I'm called to the big office for a meeting. There's too many suits, my supervisor gives me some side eye. It's not a surprise. I carefully make sure to click, "Log out of all locations" on my Google account and tuck my laptop into my car before heading upstairs.
The meeting starts with the boss saying, "Well kiddo," yes, he calls me kiddo. Since I'm not 60 years old, I'm obviously a child. "Well, Kiddo, I'm sad to say that I was wrong. I shouldn't have hired you. You're fired."
Well... that was blunt. And rude. So I stand up, extend my hand across the table, and prepare to thank him for the last few years.
"NOT so fast. Sit down, we have things to discuss."
Hahaha... what? I sit down for a moment, in brief shock. The adrenaline starts to pump and my finger tips are cold. Boss begins to tell me all of things they need from me. Contacts. Account statuses. Explanation of discrepancies on AR accounts. documentation for State interests. All things that, as his competent employee, I could have printed and sitting on his desk in moments. I decide to comply with him starting the meeting by saying I'm fired. Where I live, either of us can stop the employment situation for any reason. He had legally fired me.
I counter him, "Well, Boss, I don't feel particularly comfortable accessing your network since I'm not an employee."
He exploded. Think of Karen, a millionaire Karen with little-brother syndrome who wants to be John Wayne but looks a bit too much like Smoky the Bear's fat cousin to get the role. His explosion was violent. Spit everywhere. I'll save you the details of how he stalked me to my car and demanded the employees "form a barrier".
He called me a few times. They went to voicemail as I drove to a public wifi hotspot. I carefully removed my laptop from their network. I drove home, unpacked my work lunch. My phone hasn't stopped ringing - he probably had a receptionist being paid minimum wage to hit the "redial" button.
Eventually I answer a call from his cellphone. He makes some demands. I very flippantly offer to come to work for him at 10x my rate. He yells some more. An hour later, he's pounding on my door. I don't want to deal with that, I know he carries a loaded pistol in his car (again, cowboy - emphasis on the boy). The cops escort him away and I email a copy of my security footage to the responding officer. He thanks me.
The company doesn't flounder, of course. Bossman is a millionaire, and has been very carefully losing tens of thousands of dollars a year while operating his business. He may have lost some more in the interim. 
But that's not my concern. My concern is collecting my unemployment. And wouldn't you know, I was fired a few days before fall college class selection begins. I decide to take a few master level classes - I've had my BA for awhile, might as well get some more school in on the Boss's dime. Classes go well, and I coast through spring semester by tapping into a bit of savings. And wouldn't you know it? The pandemic happens, and my unemployment benefits are extended. Guess I'll take some summer classes. And those extended benefits were at 3x the base unemployment rate? Gee wizz, guess I can take a full set of fall classes too. And then the state extended it for another 3 months at double the base? I have winter session's signup date marked on my calendar!
The bossman calls me this morning. I coyly thank him for firing me without cause a year ago, and let him know I made the Dean's list last semester. He tells me to fuck off, he called to take me up on my deal - he'll hire me at 5x my rate to give him some information. I remind him, "Wasn't the deal 10 times my rate?"
Fuck you, 5x is too much. And I only need you for an afternoon.
"Well, I've been thinking about it. My unemployment benefits run out in a week or two. So I'll do it. I'll contract for you. I want 20x what I was making. 40 hours minimum. Paid in advance. Oh, and written scope of work - I'm only doing the work you say you need done during negotiations."
Fuck you, I'll give you 5 times and a day of work and that's final.
"No, thanks Boss. I have to get back to the classes you're paying for. Thanks again!"
I hang up. He calls back an hour later, just moments before I started writing this, actually. It's actually his daughter, the comptroller of the company. She says she spoke some reason to the boss. He'll hire me at 20x my rate for 40 hours of work, half paid up front.
Fine. she starts telling me what needs done. Turns out, they're failing a State audit quite badly. Like, "Boss is not a millionaire if this isn't fixed" kind of badly. They have all the information they need, of course - it's on my company email account's google drive.  I'm not going to tell them this. Once he pays me for half a year's work, I'll gladly spend the hour or so of time it takes to transfer all of the data he needs to a flash drive, wait until Monday of next week, and then hand it to his receptionist.
Really, the man couldn't have been nicer. He's already covered me going to college full time for over a year, and is about to cover another two semesters. I should buy him a cake.
**Edit / Update:** I got a call. They seem to have decided that the daughter/comptroller would be the best point of contact, which is fine with me. We got along fine, she has a nice kid that used to run around the office. It seems like the bulk of the issue is the information that they can't find. That's roughly zero work. But since they can't find that information at all, auditors are nitpicking very fine details that my replacements have bungled up. From the way she told it, it sounds like a nightmare. The literal end of times. Honestly it sounds like a solid day of work running through their server with some of my tools. Maybe two days. She wants me to start ASAP while they finalize writing up a contract. I gave a surprised, "Heh" of a chuckle and said no dice. Contract first, and I'll have them pass the audit perfectly, like I always used to.
I work fast.
"You don't understand, we only have until the end of the month. This needs started on today."
I work fast, and it sounds like you should hire someone who knows how to write contracts fast, too.
Sounds like a plan, good night.

There's a few places it could be.
The first and most expressly appropriate place for it to be determined would be Congress.  The 12th amendment, which sets forth the current electoral college, requires that electoral votes be counted in front of the House and Senate.  If the House and Senate voted to reject electoral votes from compact states, that could prevent it from being effective.
This would likely be expressly a political move, most likely to be done in the event that a candidate won the Presidency, but not the House or Senate.  So the 2016 election results would be an example case of this.
The closest precedent for this would be the 1876 election's electoral commission.)  In that case, three states had contested elections and there were two disputed slates of electors for each state, as well as some other alleged irregularities.  The Congress formed a special committee to resolve the crisis, and the committee ended up going 8-7 on partisan lines to resolve all the disputes in favor of Rutherford Hayes and against Samuel Tilden.  
My guess is something similarly partisan would be the result of any Congressional adjudication, and probably would only be really viable for the first use of the compact.  If the compact were used in a landslide year like 2008, when one party won everything then it would likely not be challenged.
Based on this CRS report, my understanding is current procedure is that both houses would need to agree to reject a state's electoral votes.  So if the Houses were split on partisan lines, the votes would likely be counted.
The downside to rejecting the electors would also be that we would then choose the President through the idiotic contingent election system where each state in the House gets one vote, and an absolute majority is required to win.  This had a nightmarish failure in the election of 1800 where the House had 35 successive deadlocked ballots before picking Thomas Jefferson over Aaron Burr. 
Now, what about the courts?  Almost certainly there will be lawsuits aplenty filed.  What will happen with them?  Honestly I have no idea.  The closest court case I can think of in US history would be Bush v. Gore. but it's just a much different question than the pretty small one there about a recount in one state.  The courts would be being asked to overturn a large number of states' intentional laws about elector selection.  It would also of course be a hyper-politicized case almost guaranteed to tarnish the court's reputation in the eyes of a large portion of the country.  My guess is that the courts would defer to Congress, like they did in some of the silly challenges to Obama's eligibility based on birther conspiracy theories.
The states have *extreme* powers over selection of electors.  As to controlling what electors do one selected, it is less clear.  
As noted in Rhenquist's concurrence in _Bush v. Gore,_ the constitution "conveys the broadest power of determination and leaves it to the legislature exclusively to define the method of appointment" of electors.
At the same time, the Constitution also requires that Congress consent to any interstate compact.  Assuming Congress had not consented to the compact before it got to 270 votes, this could create a bit of a conflict, though the courts have generally only required consent for compacts which diminish or enhance a state's rights or powers.)
I would also question whether or not the actual text of the compact even needs to *be* a compact.  If not, it could be subject to a saving construction which makes it be treated as not a compact even though it claims to be one.
I did a long analysis of this before on NP which I'll lust link to but suffice to say, I don't think the NPVIC actually needs to be an interstate compact, but it's a close call.
In a good faith analysis of the Constitution, I think it is.  However, it is by far most likely to be adjudicated by Congress, and given their history on this subject, I do not trust they would do a good faith analysis of the Constitution and would most likely act in the manner which provides them partisan advantage.

A martial arts expert ruined by an 11-year-old girl In the sixth grade, I bore witness to a stunning example of malicious compliance.
Several grades of classes from our elementary school were called to the gymnasium for some lessons on self-defence.  We were to be given some very rudimentary examples of how we, as children, can fight off an attacker if there are no other options. The instructor was a man who had a long martial artist title and was unbearably smug about it. Sure, he'd made some big accomplishments, but he would take every moment available to deliver his lengthy champion title verbatim. Damned if I can remember what it was; it might have been a wilful effort on my part to erase it.
He was instructing us on how to basically go belly-up like a distressed turtle and kick off an attacker. We weren't really understanding how this was feasible, and we were asking a lot of questions about it. He got tired of the questions and called up a volunteer to demonstrate the self-defence technique. He called upon Alice, a girl in my class.
He didn't just tell her how to get into position, however. He was putting his hands on her and getting her to lie belly-up on the waxed gymnasium floor in a way that was truly creepy and invasive, even to children who might not understand why. He gave her long stares and made some quiet remarks to her that we couldn't hear, but the expression on her face said, "Yuck." I was only 11 years old, but I got the gist of the situation and thought to myself, "This guy is fucking gross."
She had her legs up to kick, was making kicking motions but clearly swerving away from making direct hits to this man. It wasn't enough for him to just have the kids understand the technique. He needed to demonstrate his martial arts prowess. He said to her, "No, go ahead and fight me. This works on an amateur, but I'm a (insert his lengthy and proud title here)."
He could not have known, but my entire class knew, that Alice was a competitive swimmer. She had swimming skills beyond her years and all the medals and awards to prove it. Complete with the muscular development of someone who has spent years mastering their sport, particularly in her legs.
Alice seized the opportunity to fight off a man who was already throwing up some problematic indicators of his own predatory nature. She kicked him a few times, clipping a shin or a thigh as he artfully dodged her full-on attacks with a big grin on his face.
She then triumphantly planted her sneaker directly into his crotch with a force that made both her and this man red in the face.
He let out a strangled yelp before crumpling to the ground. He dry heaved a few times, too. He was in medical distress and some adults rushed to get him help. To the children, though, we just saw a guy get kicked in the balls by a kid, and that's comedy gold in elementary school. He was helped out of the gymnasium amid the roaring, bellyaching laughter of 100+ children.
Astoundingly enough (to me, at least), Alice was facing punishment for what had happened. Detention was already assigned, suspension was up in the air. Thankfully, Alice's mother rose up with the fury of a thousand women scorned after hearing Alice's testimony of events. Alice faced no suspension, and to my knowledge did not attend any after-school detention sessions. For the rest of the school year, she was recognized as the ultimate badass, and reigning queen of justice-by-testes.
TL;DR: Self defence assembly was called by my school, the instructor was both smug and creepy. He called up Alice to demonstrate a self-defence technique and insisted she fight him off, she crushed his reproductive organs and chaos ensued.
Edit: I understand why anyone who hasn't had the lived experiences of myself nor Alice would doubt my retelling, and it's your prerogative to feel however you want to feel. While it happened, there is little I can do to convince you of that. Please read Rule 3 of this sub before you leap to the opportunity to express as much.

It's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks I am going to abandon her and "our twins" This is all over the place. I really need help.
My wife and I (M42) have been married for 2 years together for 15.
All this time we had either not decided to have kids or had problems getting pregnant. After some medical testing we found out that it was near impossible to get pregnant due to some medical issues with her.
We were thinking of adopting when one day she came home and told me she was expecting. Ofcourse I was super happy . 
A week later we had an appointment at the gyno and she had some blood drawn. The test came back negative and ofcourse I was devastated but she wasn't. She claimed that she was pregnant and that the doctor was wrong. We took some more store-bought ones and they all came back negative. My wife is in complete denial. Now she claims we are having twins. She is buying them clothes and decorations and is pressuring me to start with the nursery.
I am at a loss and don't know what to do. My inaction is making her believe that I want to leave them and that I am going to doom my wife into the life of a single mom.
What the f is even happening. I love her but I don't know what to do.
Edit : forgott to add. I have tried talking her into therapy but she accuses me of gaslighting her

Gambling? Illegal. Unless it's run by the state and has horrendously bad odds, then go right ahead. Parade out a few big winners every so often, just gloss over the fact that by the time they take the lump sum and pay taxes, 75% of the money is gone already. It's no wonder that lottery winners are more likely to go bankrupt within 5 years than if they hadn't won, plus have high rates of divorce and even suicide. And of course then there are the losers, who spend way too much money they can't afford on the lottery every week and never win anything. 
But society loves it, giving free airtime on the local news and national coverage when the jackpot gets big, and prominent placement in every grocery and convenience store. All because it supposedly funds education, never mind that government money is fungible. The lottery is nothing more than a regressive tax on the poor and mathematically illiterate, giving false hope and harming any chance many have at financial stability.</td><td>0.0135409319193022</td><td>0.7471984819202668</td><td>3</td></tr>

This story pertains to an embedded system which runs a custom Linux distribution as its operating system. It requires periodical updates, which involve downloading some software from the manufacturer website and copying it to a USB stick. You plug this USB stick into the system and an option appears in the menu to perform the upgrade. From here, the upgrade is a fully automatic process.
The person I was assisting duly downloaded and copied the relevant files, only to find that the option to upgrade from the USB stick did not appear in the menu.
I search through all of the menus. Can't find that option.
I try rebooting the system. Still can't find that option.
I try rebooting the system with the USB stick in a different port. Nothing
We try all of the USB ports. Nothing.
I *finally* look up the installation instructions. Step one is to download the software ZIP file. *Step two is to unzip it and place the contents of the ZIP onto the USB stick.* I will reiterate - everyone involved was very familiar with the concept of ZIP files, and with this type of situation in general.
A suspicion dawns. I ask, "Did you read the installation instructions for this software?"
I remove the USB stick and plug it into a Windows machine. Sure enough, on the USB stick is a single, lone ZIP file.
Right-click. "Extract". Eject from Windows machine. Plug into system we are trying to upgrade. Bingo. The option appears.

Python and Perl are equivalent functionally (they're both Turing complete).  Python is what we used to call a "Bondage and Discipline" language.  Such languages are great for teaching, and for instilling good habits.  But, perforce, they prevent large classes of cleverness -- and for some kinds of problem, they are actively antagonistic.  Back when dinosaurs ruled the Earth, the king of all B&D languages was Pascal.  It was a relatively new thing.  People loved it for the discipline it enforced.  Folks loved it so much that they forsook C and wrote entire operating systems in Pascal!  (MacOS was written that way -- but even Jobs came to his senses and switched new development to C after the whole NeXT side-track affair).  
Python is very similar to Pascal in that respect.  Because it is taught in school and because it enforces a certain discipline, it easily becomes a lingua franca, and as a result there is a continent-sized mound of Python code around.  But it is not a language for clever people.  It is specifically designed to keep clever people from being clever, so that their code is more understandable by people who are, well, ordinary.   
Perl looks like line noise to folks who have not used it, because of two main elements.  The first is the sigils.  Sigils are really awesome and once you've used them Python seems really hackneyed and weird.  Why, for example, should classes share the same name space as scalar variables?  That is weird.  In English, it would be as if you could use "fish" to mean either an animal, or a class of animals, or a verb -- but not more than one of those things in the same essay.  Perl allows that, by marking which one you mean.  The second is that Perl is specifically written to allow clever people to be clever.  It is full of delightful surprises that work the way they "ought" to work, if one thinks through the consequences of the language.  But for people who do not delight in that kind of thinking, it is just weird and confusing.
In brief:  Perl is not line noise, and Python is not pseudocode.  Perl is a language for people who like Monty Python: weird but somehow logical and extremely effective.  Python is a language for people who like Battlestar Galactica: futuristic but with straightforward plot devices that are easy to follow and to recall.</td><td>My old boss did something like that a couple years ago. Made some changes on a switch to enable a new IP camera system we were installing, but got some things jacked up, so he rebooted the switch. Unfortunately, there were a bunch of other important configuration elements which had been made previously, but *never copied to the boot configuration*. So when the switch came back up, it was missing a bunch of things that were pretty much mission critical for that section of the plant.
He eventually got it reconfigured to the working setup and then got the IP cameras added successfully, but it took him a couple of days to get it all worked out. Somehow, in all that time since the previous configuration changes had been made, the switch had never gone down, so he had forgotten that the running config had never been saved to the startup config.</td><td>0.0135533426725222</td><td>0.700870968462513</td><td>3</td></tr>

But the house they moved into is on well water. Well, the well ended up having some creature dying in it (that's my hypothesis, because the bacteria found in the water comes off of dead mammals), a few months after they moved in, and the landlord still hasn't done anything about it. The city sent people to test the well (which is how we know about the bacteria) but the landlord won't do anything, and the city can't do anything other than test the water without the landlord permission. My parents have been buying bottled and jugged water for 2 years almost, so that they have water to drink and cook with. I have 4 siblings, one who is just over a year old, living in that house, plus my parents. That is a lot of water they've had to purchase because of this. My parents can't afford to move out, and I can't afford to help, so they're stuck there. 
I'm pretty sure they want to take legal action, but again, I don't think they can afford it, especially if they lose, and then the landlord kicks them out.

> waive or modify Federal student financial assistance program requirements to help students and their families or academic institutions affected by a war, other military operation, or national emergency
This was originally written to forgive loans for soldiers going to Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11.
The law requires not just an emergency to exist, but that the students being forgiven are "affected by" the emergency. The administration argues that covid is that emergency but can we really say that every couple earning under 250k was affected by covid and those earning more were not? Covid has nothing to do with the student loan situation of most of these borrowers.
I think an additional important point to consider here is that loan forgiveness **is** spending and adds to the debt. This action will cost the government between $600B and $1T, which if it were passed as a standalone bill would be one of the largest standalone pieces of spending ever (compare to Obama's $700B stimulus package in 2009). The executive branch does not have the power of the purse. I don't see how the 2003 bill could delegate unlimited spending authority to the president, and the current Supreme Court is a fan of the principle that "congress doesn't hide elephants in mouseholes".
All that said, standing will be a challenge. However, the precedent that the executive can just spend money as it wishes because no one can allege particular harm and sue seems dangerous to me.</td><td>0.0135571337171114</td><td>0.657197489792698</td><td>3</td></tr>

This is the original text from the book where Desiderata was first published.
Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.
Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.
Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.
Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful.

Not enough for this Karen Hey guys, I've lurked here for a little while now, and figured I'd share a story from my my call centre days that you guys might appreciate. the full interaction of the call was around 45 minutes, with a lot of talking in circles as Karens tend to do, so I'm going to try my best to condense it down to the interesting parts
So this happened when I was supporting the floor for a team taking calls for a large  American cellphone company. The last agent on my team is taking their last call, and I'm just getting things ready to head out for the night (around midnight-ish, we're the last team to finish for the night) when the agent comes to my cubicle with a look of absolute dread. Immediate escalation. I toss on my headset and tell my agent to send her over as soon as possible. She cold transfers her to me, which I totally get, and I get my first blast from this Karen right out of the gate. K - Karen M- Me
M-"Hey there, Karen. I'm DBMaxx, and I am currently supervising the floor, I understand you're looking to talk with me, how can I help you out?"
I ask, but I have her account in front of me at this point, and see a bill coming due for a little more than $16000. I suspect this is going to be our issue.
K-"There is absolutely no fucking way I'm paying this bill, this is unacceptable!"
M-"Yeah no, I totally get where you're coming from. I definitely wouldn't be prepared for a bill like that, let me take a look and see whats going on here and get this sorted out."
It's at this point when I open the bill in question and see a roughly $16000 charge for roaming data. Uh-oh.
Karen here went on vacation to a very beautiful, yet very remote island. The going rate for data is an eye-watering $15 per megabyte. Karen used over a gigabyte of data while on this vacation.
Now I'm sure a lot of people are thinking "are there no protections that stop things like this from happening?" and you'd be absolutely right. We sent over 40 text messages warning about data use and notifying what the current charges for data were at the time, as well as turned off her data at the $500 mark, which she manually turned back on.
While I'm looking through the account figuring out what exactly happened here, Karen screams obscenities about how evil we are, and how I'm personally going to be jailed for this offence until I finally chime in and get the ball rolling.
M-"Okay, Karen, so just taking a look here, I can see the discrepancy in the bill is caused by a charge from data use while travelling, let me see if-"
K-"I did NOT use that much data, that is fucking ridiculous. How can you even say that, how stupid are you?"
M-"Well, taking a look here I see over a gigabyte of data usage on the week of 'the vacation', which, as you were advised, is billed at $15/mb"
K-"Nobody notified me of anything. There was no I could have known it would cost that much."
M-"I understand no employee advised you before your trip, but that is only because you never called us, and we had no idea your vacation was coming so soon."
K-"I was too busy to call you guys. I don't work for you guys, I don't know these things."
M-"I get that, but we also notified you over 40 times about these data charges, all of them including your current charge as well as the data rate for the area you're in. I understand this is a large bill, but we gave you every opportunity to call us and rectify the situation, and you chose not to, at this point I can offer you a maximum of $750 as a credit towards the charge."
K-"Are you fucking kidding me? $750? That's fucking nothing. I go on facebook and watch a FEW videos, and get THIS bill? You're such a fucking idiot I'm not paying a cent for this."
This is where things get interesting. I look through incredibly old policies on international travel, when I find one that actually lets me rerate charges from this particular country, for god-knows what reason, all the way down to $2/mb. Still a lot of money for a cell phone bill, but is sure as shit better than what she had right now. All in all the credit I could apply, using this policy to justify it, was about $14000. I'm ecstatic coming to the phone, this should be a slam dunk.
M-"So looking through some older policies, I've found one that allows me to apply 14 thousand(!!!) dollars to your account, thank you so much for being patient with me, I'm glad we could find a better solution here"
M-"Whoah there, let's not forget, even without the charge we're talking about, you still have your regular services to pay for."
K-"I feel like this has been horrible enough customer service, you should waive the charges for that to, it's the least you could do at this point."
M-"Well, I'm sorry to tell you, that's not how this works, and the absolute most I can apply is the 14 thousand I have already offered, and that alone is orders of magnitude larger than any other single credit I've personally applied."
K-"You're fucking heartless. I need to speak to YOUR boss right fucking now"
M-"If I could I would, but at this point it's almost 1AM where we're located and I'm quite literally the last person in this office, there is nobody above me you can talk to, if you'd like I can send her an email letting her know you would like to talk, she'll be in this morning."
M-"The email is sent, I've gotta warn you, though, she might not come up with the same solution I have."
So this ends my interaction with her, but then the department manager gets my email in the morning, thoroughly laying out the conversation the night prior, as well as my findings. My manager scrolls through the account quickly, laughs, then immediately puts on her headset and dials out to the customer. She very briefly, and very sternly advised the customer that this was not the first time a "mistake" like this has happened on the account, and and that due to these past interactions the most she would offer was a $25 courtesy credit, then advised any further inquiries about this issue would be forwarded to the fraud department for them to review. What a badass. A part of me feels bad about it, but the overwhelming majority of me says fuck that she did so many things to deserve that
TL:DR woman admittedly used phone on vacation, refused 14 thousand dollar credit towards her bill.
I apologise this came out longer than I expected, but I hope you guys still find it entertaining.</td><td>Your mom is a JN, big-time. As others in the comments have said, mom isn't a "soft place to land", she's a concrete pit with metal spikes -- *stay away*. Your husband is trying to protect his new family from one who clearly wants to cause damage to it, if not outright destruction (i.e. your mother). You and hubby are a team now -- stick together no matter what she tries to do. Your husband is revealing his shiny spine and is trying to do his job to protect you from JNMom's machinations -- put on your sunglasses and hang on, cuz it's going to be a helluva ride.
> I feel like she's saying "I know you're going to get divorced one day, but don't worry, I'll be here for you when that happens."
That's *exactly* what she's saying, and even hoping for. Worst case, *she'll try to bring that prophecy to fulfillment* through her manipulations, just to maintain her control over you. She will try to pit you against hubby; *do not fall into the trap*. You say you don't want to rock the boat. It's understandable, but you *need* to flip that boat over and *throw her out of it*. Do everything you and hubby can to get out of her house and into your own place as quickly as possible. You're freaking out and mad at hubby, even though you agree in principle with what he said.  That's what *she* wants, though -- you angry at *him* instead of *her* over what *she* did wrong. *That's the trap*. Let your anger at him subside, because he did what was necessary at the moment. Your husband is not the enemy here; he's your greatest ally. I think you know that, but years of indoctrination from the *real* enemy have you reacting knee-jerk. Suppress the brainwashing and look at it rationally.
Set those boundaries, set clear penalties, and *stick to them*. If you have trouble doing it, let your husband run interference -- it seems like he's already getting into the battle here, and I think he's up to the task. Until you're strong enough to get all the way out of the FOG, let him be the bad guy (as far as mom is concerned), but don't let him do it alone; *stick with him* -- he's going to need your support. Don't let your mom tear the two of you apart.
> EDIT: I did confront her after the rent thing to let her know I thought we had agreed on just utilities, and she did back down, but it was in that moment we realized some weird dynamics were at play.
Excellent! You stood to her up in a relatively simple matter, and *you won*. Let that build some confidence in yourself. You also begin to see how things are going to start playing out, so be prepared for bigger and harder battles. Take it one battle at a time, one day at a time, and let hubby help -- that's one of the things we husbands are there for in our marriages. Don't get complacent -- get ready for the next encounter.
I'll echo what others have already said -- get some counseling to help you clear the FOG. And above all else, *talk with your husband*. He is there for you, just as much as you are there for him. He seems to have the strength you need right now to get clear -- use it, and eventually you will have your own strength and the confidence to use it.
I know that science-fiction is not everyone's cup of tea, and especially not Star Trek. But there's an episode of Deep Space Nine that I think is worth a watch (season 6, episode 7, "You Are Cordially Invited") -- Worf and Jadzia's wedding ceremony in the last few minutes of the episode. I think it shows a picture of what you and your new husband need to be in your current situation -- a united force fighting against all who would destroy you (i.e. your mother and any flying monkeys she sends your way), watching each other's backs, and picking each other up when something knocks you or hubby down. This *will* be a battle, and you need to be ready to fight it. You have already noticed the problems, and you agree with what hubby wrote. You just need the confidence in both him and the two of you together, and the strength to break through a lifetime of mom's programming.</td><td>0.0686088630876722</td><td>0.8010158740527049</td><td>4</td></tr>

Mikasa was not in love with Ereh, she was hooked on him in a unhealthy way, which is the same as King Fritz and Yamir. Is this a good ending? Not a fucking chance in fuck. Only Yamir knows why her relationship with Fritz translates to stopping the Titan curse by seeing it mimicked but overcome by Mikasa, but this was Yams intention. The ONLY way any of this dumpsterfire makes 1 iota of sense is that Mikasa and Ereh are not in love, otherwise they are not parallels to Yamir/Fritz and therefore makes no sense that it would relate to stopping the titans. 
Quick second point: as I said before the ending only makes any amount of sense if Ereh and Mikasa aren't in love for what Yams wrote in connection to Yamir and Fritz to end the curse. But then Ereh bitches about Mikasa finding someone else.

In this case, Ereh isn't like the King at all, and is even more evidence and this ending makes no fucking sense at all even within the confines of its own plot. 
tldr; Ereh and Mikasa aren't in love, and if they are the ending makes negative sense.

So I remembered this one after reading the cheating story.
Back a couple of years ago I worked in a small inbound call centre for a fleet company. Our department specifically handled calls from customers who had cars leased through their employers as part of their salary. We had very strict privacy policy but (and this is the important thing) you could have more than one additional person authorised on the account.
So to the call of the day.
A lady calls up asking for access to the details of her husbands lease, no problems she has access and passed the security questions. We go through a few details and I could tell from the start that she was fishing for something and as soon as I opened the back leasing documents I knew what was coming. Turns out husband has added his girlfriend onto the insurance and also as an authorised person on the account. Now we send the  documents automatically to the email address held on file, which husband stupidly has as his wife's email. She knows but want to confirm in case it was mistake between accounts. I apologise and confirm the information while she's crying. She thanks me and after a few more minutes ends the call.
I think this is terrible but shrug and go onto the next call. But of course thats not the end of it.
A couple of hours later husband calls yelling and screaming. Now I didn't originally get this call but it went to the most junior member of the team and being the next senior staff member under the manager she asked if I could take over the call for her (our manager was chill and let us do this for the juniors). During the transfer he never stopped yelling until he realised he was speaking to someone else. 
He rants and raves for a while until I security check him and confirm to him that he put his wife's and girlfriends details on the account and it was his decision to do so. After he calms down a bit it comes out why hes so upset ( no sympathy I think he deserved everything that happened to him)
Turns out wife also works for the same company, different department but senior to him. First call she made was to her boss to have the company aware of the sitation and to have them check the company credit card. It seems old mate was also treating his girlfriend to dinner on the company dollar as well as other personal expenses.
He was summarily fired from his position. As the car is through the company he no longer has a lease with us and has to pay the financier directly (it was not cheap) and has lost all benefits included fuel cards, maintenance and insurance. I could do nothing to help him, by the time he has called all this information has come through from his employer and is effective immediatly (in fact the documents were already in the post and had been emailed).
After calling her boss it turns out wife had used the contact details she got sent and contacted the girlfriend, who was not aware he was married. Girlfriend was apparently a little crazy and went to his workplace and keyed the car and punctured the tires. 
Now he can fill an insurance claim because the policy wouldn't cancel until midnight but he wanted roadside assistance and replacement tires.  After about 30 mins I got through to him that he wouldn't be getting either and would have to arrange it himself. I also did recommend that he contacts the police. He finally ends the call after berating me, my employer and his former employer. He also sends in an email complaint against me personally.
My boss shrugs it off, the big boss shrugs it off and I continue to take calls. 
I know the wife was satisfied because she signed up for a lease herself a few weeks later. I spoke to her a couple more times while I still worked there. They got divorced, she got the house because it was premarital asset and I think he deserved everything he got for his stupid actions.
TLDR: Guy adds both wife and girlfriend on lease. Wife finds out, he loses his job, the lease and the girlfriend trashes his car. Also loses wife and house.</td><td>Trustworthy?

Well, there is a reason for that. A very good reason. 
JYMOM and MS didn't really meet until our wedding and didn't talk much there. Afterwards, they had no real extended interactions until the birth of oldest LO. 
MS has a daughter but always assumed she would be in the room when oldest LO was born. I told her *no*. DH told her *no*. JYSIL told her *no*. But, sure enough, when it was go-time, I found myself in the hospital room with DH hugging my face, my mother stepping out to get the nurse and MS parked on the fucking couch. The baby nurse came in and asked if she was staying and she says *yes* at the exact time DH and I said *no* in unison. The nurse pretended not to hear and went on about her business. 
DH didn't have a spine at this time, so he just held my hand tighter and told me it was going to be ok. I started to cry just as JYMOM walked in the room. 
MS, decked out in her Sunday best, legit crossed her legs and smirked at all of us. Another nurse walked in and reminded our group that only two people were allowed in, but MS didn't move. 
Not until JYMOM spoke up, that is. 
Mom looks at her, lowers her voice and simply says:
I got the shivers. Room got cold as ice. DH retreated even more into rubbing my hand and the nurses, visibly shook worked to keep themselves busy. MS looked like she wanted to say something, but the stare down she was receiving will go down in history. So save face, she kinda just glided up out of the couch and out the door without a peep. 
That was the first time she tried my mom. 
The second time was at oldest LO's first birthday party. I wanted a small get together at my house. She complained about not being able to invite a bunch of her friends that we didn't know. She complained it was too far (at the time, we lived closer to her than her daughter did). She complained about the colors. In other words, I could do nothing right. But, most of all, she complained about how she couldn't believe he was turning 1 and how he had never spent the night at herrrr house!
So anyway, party day. Keep in mind, I didn't know this happened until my mom told me after it was all over. I was playing with LO and talking to everyone most of the day anyway. Afterwards, while mom and I were cleaning, she told me that MS tried to corner her about how much time she got to spend with oldest LO. Apparently, MS assumed that my mom has him
overnight all the time, even though we had told MS nobody kept him overnight. What MS didn't know was that my mom already knew about all of this (because we are close) and that my mom also doesn't like anyone messing with her daughter. Of course, I'm paraphrasing, but it went something like this:
MS: you must be so excited since you get to keep LO all the time!
Mom: I *visit* LO when my daughter wants me to, I don't keep LO. 
MS: oh, I'm suuuure you get to keep him! She's never let me have a sleepover with him. 
Mom: no, I don't. But, you already know that because it's something my daughter has already told you. 
MS: are you calling me a liar right now?
Since then, the air has always been chilly around those two, but MS seems to get the point that my mom is not one to be played with.
Edit: Mom has always been the community momma. I have so many surrogate brothers and sisters that it isn't funny!
Something else awesome about her: she gets along with everyone. She encourages boundaries (even putting herself aside to make sure we have them), is never demanding or overbearing and is always kind. My brother had been married and divorced three times (I know), but all of his ex wives still refer to my mom as "Momma" and frequent her house or frequently call just to check in.

That is the *exact opposite* of equality. It was always sexist to adjust policy based on sweeping generalizations about sexes or races. For example, just because women *statistically* are smaller and weaker doesn't mean that women should be excluded from jobs requiring size and strength, like firefighters. To make policy based on the *statistical* trait of their sex was sexist. Women fought long and hard for the right to be judged based on *individual merit*, and sure enough many women can, and do, perform work that takes great strength. There are strong women and weak men. Yes, *statistically* men are bigger and stronger, and hence you will *statistically* find more men capable of being firefighters than women, but that is irrelevant to the equality of a test of *individual merit*.
That's the inherent sexism of Ellen Pao's policy, and similar ones. They treat people based on the statistical traits of their sexes, not on their individual merits. It's a reversal of the movement of equality.
With respect to race, Martin Luther King's dream was "I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character." Likewise, gender equality looks to the day when people will not be judged by their biological sex, or their sexual orientation, but by the content of their character and the merit of their skills.
Pao spits on MLK's dream. She changes the rules specifically because of the statistical traits of people's biological sex and not to their individual character or skills.

Hello, We're in the process of trying to test out a new firewall and are working through how to test it a veryspecific way on our production network.
If you look at the drawing I linked, you'll see that we have two sites and the firewall at site2 is the one we're looking to replace. However, we'd like to install the new firewall at Site1 and use the same address space that is behind Site2's Firewall so that when it's time to do the cutover, there will be less changes to make. Additionally, installing the new Firewall at Site2 in parallel will require us to work with the organization that manages the Site2 router highlighted in red. It difficult to to make changes on that device and we are trying to avoid having to do that.
I don't have a lot of experience with VRFs but all of my initial searches online regarding using the same address space for 2 different areas of a network point me to VRFs. I also realize that it may be easier to just stand put the new firewall in parallel at site1 using address space that is natively behind Site1's router and firewall but I'm trying to avoid doing that in an effort to minimize the changes needed at cutover. Additionally, I'd like to avoid VRFs if possible because this testing is being done in parallel to a production network. That being said, would it be so simple to just have an additional VRF on the site1 router and install connections between the router, new firewall, and core switch shown in the diagram, and then just give it the same address space as site 2?
If anyone has a high-level explanation of how one would get this to work, I'd really appreciate it.

The compact currently has 172 electoral votes in 11 states, and more states will hold votes to join. Is this constitutional? What power do states have over their chosen electors? Several states have banded together to effectively overturn the Electoral College through passage of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.
Currently representing 172 electoral votes in 11 states and the District of Columbia, the Popular Vote Compact would de-facto turn national Presidential elections into a popular vote should states representing 270 electoral votes join.
In practice, the way this would work is your state electors would go to the winner of the national popular vote instead of your state vote.
**For example, if you live in California and a Democrat won the state popular vote 57%-43%, the Democrat would typically be given the whole 55 electoral votes California has.**
**In this new system, California would look to the winner of the national popular vote. If California still voted 57%-43% for a Democrat and the national vote was 51%-49% in favor of a Republican, the state would give their 55 votes to the Republican.**
On the mechanism (from 2nd source):
> The compact would modify the way participating states implement Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which requires each state legislature to define a method to appoint its electors to vote in the Electoral College. The Constitution does not mandate any particular legislative scheme for selecting electors, and instead vests state legislatures with the exclusive power to choose how to allocate their states' electors (although systems that violate the 14th Amendment, which mandates equal protection of law and prohibits racial discrimination, would be prohibited). States have chosen various methods of allocation over the years, with regular changes in the nation's early decades. Today, all but two states (Maine and Nebraska) award all their electoral votes to the candidate with the most votes statewide (the "winner-take-all" system).
On enactment (from the 3rd source):
> "When we hit 270, all these bills take effect simultaneously. Then there's a pool of 270 electoral votes that's going to go to whomever gets the most votes in all 50 states," Koza added.
Somewhat relevant, the United States has been willing to move towards direct elections in the past, at least in the case of Senators.
I have a couple of questions:
1: Is this constitutional? When and where will this be determined if it's not?
2: States aren't exactly getting rid of their electoral votes - they're just writing legislation that changes the prerogative of their electors. What power do states have over their electors?</td><td>> "I have been exploring a special prompt that I will be publishing at a later date, I have created 100s of images using it, and after many weeks of fine tuning and curating my gens, I chose my top 3 and had them printed on canvas after unshackling with Gigapixel AI," ...

I'm French and we met while he was on vacation in Europe, one thing lead to another and now I live in Ohio with him. He is a hard working gentleman, an army veteran of 2 conflicts, and thought he has a very serious and almost hostile demeanor (think resting bitch face, but angrier and on a guy) he is a big teddy bear, quick to make a joke or pull a prank and easy to laugh. He is also VERY protective of me. Since I'm not here to gush on him, I'll go on.
We were out getting groceries last week, as we were checking out I was bagging up all our stuff because the store now requires that you bag your own goods if you bring your own bags. No big deal. He pays, and I stay to help a very elderly lady behind him bag her groceries and put them in her cart (he had helped her unload them) and we offered to help her put them in her car. She shuffles away from the register and I move to follow, as I turn away I hear behind me "Where the HELL do you think you're going?"  
I turn to see a very angry looking woman glaring at me. I told her politely that I didn't work at the store and I had just helped the elderly lady to be polite and that I was now leaving with my husband to go home. I had never met an American Karen before so I thought this would be the end of it, I turn to walk away and feel a vice grip on my arm. "Don't be LAZY! Just do your job and help bag my groceries!"  
I didn't even have time to respond, she had barely finished speaking when my husband wrenched her hand off me and was yelling in her face. This was the first time in the 10 years we've been together that I saw the old soldier come out, his nose might have been 3 inches from hers and his voice was loud and frightening, "WHO THE F\*\*\* DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? HOW DARE PUT YOUR HANDS ON MY WIFE! SHE TOLD YOU SHE DOESN'T WORK HERE, ARE YOU TOO F\*\*\*ING STUPID TO UNDERSTAND SIMPLE ENGLISH? GO PAY FOR YOUR SHIT, BAG YOUR OWN DAMN GROCERIES AND DON'T YOU DARE UTTER ANOTHER F\*\*\*ING SOUND!"  
The the silence after that was intense, a store full of people could hear a pin drop. The look on her face wasn't even angry, it was pure terror. She shuffled back to here isle and waited for the cashier. My husband went to the old lady and said, "I am so sorry you had to hear all that, ma'am. I apologize if my language was offensive. I hope you will still allow us to help you load your groceries into your car."  
It was surreal, like he had just flipped on a switch and flipped it back off.  
Also, we got chased down by the store manager who suggested we could be banned because of the yelling and bad language. Husband just shrugged and said they had better ban the Karen too for assaulting me, and that there are other grocery stores in town, we just go to this one because it's close.

So once the seating arrangements are situated, I take his order. All seems well until I bring out his food. I set his food down and just as I'm about to ask if he needs any condiments, this man yells at me.

Yesterday, after seeing this story, I attempted to enable end-to-end encryption between the camera and my phone, which would block Ring and law enforcement from seeing the camera live or any recordings.
Ring makes this intentionally hard to find and difficult to do. There are 3 steps buried deep in a menu in the app. Eventually, they generate a 9-word passphrase that's about 50 characters long. They advise storing this in a password manager, but they do not allow copying it to the clipboard (at least from the Android app). Therefore, you have to manually retype 50 characters. I screenshotted it, retyped it elsewhere, and attempted to reproduce it as required, but the app said the phrase was wrong. After checking it about 5 times, I gave up. Hanlon's Razor aside, burying the feature this much and requiring users to manually retype 50 characters instead of allowing the clipboard has to be intentional to discourage the use of this feature.
The steps I tried to follow are here. If others find an easier way to make this work, I'd love to hear it.
Edit: took another crack at this by typing on a PC and was able to get the thing enrolled in E2E encryption. But enabling this turns off basically all of the useful features of being on Ring (motion notifications, video pre-roll, shared links, event timeline, and about a dozen others).

But here's the kicker. EVEN IF we give you the benefit of the doubt after years of lying about context to smear president Trump, he only revealed what GENERAL MILLEY had already illegally leaked to the media - that there was a plan to attack Iran.
So why was Milley not prosecuted when he was the one who made public this super secret information that YOU YOURSELF claim to be so concerned about? As you said, how can you vote for the people who play it so loose with classified information??? Why do you vote for the people who went after Trump here but not Milley, who leaked this classified info?
I suspect you cannot respond to these points because they completely debunk you. They blow your entire world view here out of the water and prove you're without a doubt the one who is wrong.
> This rebuts everything he stood for against Hillary
1) Hillary was not the president and did not have the authority to decide classification status.
2) Hillary's server was totally insecure and likely hacked, giving valuable information to the enemy. Every single document even MARKED classified was found either in Trump's dedicated storage fascility or his office according to the indictment itself (all the pictures of boxes in bathrooms and on the stage were FAKE as none contained any documents that were marked classified). Maralago served as the second white house during Trump's term and is protected by secret service. It is incredibly secure and not in any way comparable to how Clinton handled classified material.
3) Hillary kept the private server to run under the table deals and hide the information from the public and dodge FOIA requests. When the public came after her she could completely delete all the evidence and corresponsence that the public has a legal right to oversee. And ultimately that is exactly what she did, even going so far as to wipe and smash her hard drives that were UNDER SUBPEONA which is blatant obstruction of justice.

Obviously the FBI investigation has been well documented but lots of this other stuff was new to me.

I have no idea whether Gaetz is the person this article alleges but I do know this is a hit piece.
> In an incident from 2012, Gaetz and some of his legislator bros got drunk at a Disney resort and made a loud scene in the lobby. He attempted to bribe the front desk attendant with $20 to get access to another guest's room.
The ultimate source for this is here. It alleges that Gaetz was one of many who were there but the assertion that he is the one who did this seems to be made up by the Medium author.
> However, in this case the arresting officer was forced to resign in lieu of being fired in an "unrelated" matter within a week of Gaetz's arrest. The judge then quietly dismissed all charges. He somehow even avoided the suspended license. It's good to have a dad who's a leading state senator. 
Those scare quotes around "unrelated" and the last sentence certainly read like Gaetz and his Dad got this officer fired to make a problem go away. What does the actual article cited tell us?
> On Nov. 10, Anglin made a DUI arrest in Destin. An internal affairs report said that Anglin grabbed the suspect around the neck after he believed the suspect spit on him. But three other deputies, including a trainee, were there as well, and said the spitting was unintentional and that Anglin used unreasonable force. An internal affairs report agreed.
> According to Anglin's personnel file, this was his fourth infraction, and third in a year.
Now it certainly seems like Gaetz should have been charged and convicted, but it's hard to do that when the arresting officer has been fired for repeated misconduct.
> They recalled one incident of him making jokes about hiring strippers for a Super Bowl party he organized. 
A joke about strippers? Scandalous!
> Two sources, including a Republican state representative who served alongside Gaetz in the Florida House in 2014–15, have accused Matt Gaetz of coming up with a sex game when he served in the state legislature.
I have no idea whether this is true, but the source of it seems to be a Twitter feud between him and another state legislator where the other guy references a tweet that claims an anonymous source for this. Weak.
> It turned out there was an incomprehensible plot to defraud the Gaetz's out of $25 million...If your head is spinning in disbelief, that's the appropriate response. None of that made a lick of sense. 
You'd think an article published 4 days after the extortionist pleaded guilty to extortion would mention this fact rather than write paragraphs about how far-fetched the plot was. Obviously the Biden DOJ, which accepted the plea and wrote a press release about it, finds the story to make sense despite the author's incredulity. The failure to mention this plea removes any shred of credibility this author might have had. 
> He was a congressman in his late 30s who had never been married or even romantically associated with anyone. I think it's fair to say that many assumed he was gay. After all, being a Republican in an ultra-conservative district, that's the kind of thing you might want to keep quiet. I mean his colorful suits and immaculate hair just screamed closeted homosexual.
Is it actually OK to just assume people are probably gay because they are single, dress well, and have good hair? I've seen the left lob these accusations at others (like Lindsay Graham) and I can't help but feel like this would be considered homophobic if the right did it.
I could go on, but it's tiring to try to fact-check this stuff given the author's twisting. This piece seems to be a collection of truths, half-truths, and rumors built around the one thing we know is true (the FBI investigation) to push a narrative.</td><td>0.041563949285474</td><td>0.7347900030863869</td><td>4</td></tr>

TL;DR I took a booking for a local hotel I didn't work for, that was about to be demolished.
Back in the late 90s I worked bar in a small town in rural Ireland (\~500 people, 3 pubs, 1 hotel).  It's a wee seaside village and quite picturesque, and is therefore plagued by tourists during any holidays.  We lived directly opposite the hotel. The hotel was about to be ~~raised~~ razed (cheers [user] !) to the ground and rebuilt without the 60 years of nicotine stains.  The demolition was due to start in January, and the work due to be completed some time in 2003.
It's a small town.  Everyone knows everything as long as it's about someone else's business!
The hotel's reception phone number is 1 number away from my parent's landline number.  It's new year's eve, or more accurately \~4am on new year's day.  I'm home from my shift dealing with drunk eejits that, as this was the 90s, want nothing but baileys & creme de menthe shots and bacardi breezers, with the occasional Irish coffee and pint of Guinness that they'll order last as an afterthought and then complain about the wait.
4am.  My parent's living room.  I'm having a wee decompress and a whiskey.

"Awright mucker?  I've had a fuckin crackin time tonight we're booking the same nights for next year. Room 109, Jamie Cuntface"
"Ah sorry mate, you'll have bother, TownName hotel is closing in January and re-opening in 2003, and the number for reception is 555-5545, this is a private residence"

\[3\]COW FUCKER BASTARD:  A bastard who fucks cows.  Belfast people often accuse the rurals of cow fucking, which is odd because pigs are so much lower maintainance and you can test cosmetics on them to pretty them up.

I put on my best receptionist voice.
"Good morning, Townname hotel reception! How can I help you?  Is that Mister J Cuntface from room 109?  How may I be of service?"
"That's better. I wanna book for next year same nights"
"Certainly Mister Cuntface. We even have a 50% loyalty discount as you're a previous guest!  Same days?"
"Okay that's all booked in for next year, arriving on the morning of the 31st?  Yes?"

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>Secures firm control with the hand(s) or arm(s) of a live ball in flight before the ball touches the ground, and >>> 3.</td><td>People walk in, take what they want, and walk out.</td><td>My thoughts on the Clemson Incompletion: What's a Catch? In the past 12 or so hours since the end of the OSU v. Clemson game I've seen a lot of hot takes, misunderstandings, and straight up misinformation about what is or isn't a catch. I thought I'd try and do a write up of this call in particular, mainly because what I've seen thus far seems inadequate.
If you want the **TLDR: I think they got the call correct by overturning it.**
Without further ado, let's break this down.
The NCAA provides for us the rules free of charge. I'll go ahead and copy out the relevant sections here:
> Catch, Interception, Recovery
>> a. To catch a ball means that a player:
>>> 1. Secures firm control with the hand(s) or arm(s) of a live ball in flight before the ball touches the ground, and
>>> 3. Maintains control of the ball long enough to enable him to perform an act common to the game, i.e., long enough to pitch or hand the ball, advance it, avoid or ward off an opponent, etc., 
>> h. When in question, the catch, recovery or interception is not completed. 
We will circle back to these later
>Procedures
>> c. All reviews shall be based upon video evidence provided by and coming directly from the televised production of the game or from other video means available to the replay official that is also available to the television producer. 
I do not have a copy of the CCA Mechanics Manual, but at this level of football, officials are instructed to beanbag fumbles and review them in the booth. If one of the NCAA officials on here could copy out the phrasing, please do.
So now that we've established these lets jump right in
These are enumerated above, but to expand on them:
* Tucking the ball
* Extending the ball for the goal line
* Moving the ball away from a defender
* Advancing under your own power
* Taking steps BY ITSELF is not an act common to the game. Maintaining feet from the point of contact is not indicative in and of itself a move common to the game. Imagine in this hypothetical scenario that that the Clemson WR had remained with his hands on the ball and went to the ground. He would have been marked down by forward progress where he initially contacted the ball, as he did not actively make these steps. So lets dispense with that one right now.
* Trying to do any of the above and failing in the process is not indicative of a move common to the game.
* The speed of the ball carrying it to your helmet is not a move common to the game. 
**Looking at replays and thinking through the process**
Unfortunately these are the only clips I have from the game, as most of the articles through page 3 of google simply use the sportscenter slowmo. If anyone has other clips please send them too me so I can edit it in.
So full speed, the HLJ is perfectly in position to make this call. He's about 3 yards from the play, judging by where his hat is pointed he's staring right at this catch. As soon as he sees the ball come out, he drops his beanbag and runs to the GL for the reverse mechanic, and the R signals the TD. As a scoring play, it immediately goes to review.
Looking back at the mechanics manual, the HLJ drops the bean bag to cover himself. If he blows the whistle and it was in-fact a fumble for a TD, he's probably never going to work a CFP game again for having an inadvertent whistle on a scoring play.
Now that we are in the review, we need to have firm control, and an act common to the game.
Full Speed Front View - From here we can see that the steps taken are from the force of contact by the DB from the moment of catching, the steps alone do not count as our move common. This leaves an attempt to ward or tuck.
Slow Motion Back Cam - From 0:03 to 0:05 we can see the WR left hand come off of the ball while attempting to tuck it to his waist, at which point the ball is dislodged by the DB.
Given this, I don't think this is a catch, but it's still a very close call.
Circling back to subsection h, *"When in question, the catch, recovery or interception is not completed."* Given that the HLJ let the play go as he wasn't sure it was a catch or not, and that it seems unclear after looking at this all day whether he completes his act common, this is ruled incomplete.
For games such as this, the call is reviewed at the SEC HQ, the replay booth, and on the field. Given that all crews independently came to the same conclusion, I feel quite confident that this was the right call.
*Can the replay booth/HQ overrule the field crew?*
No, the ruling of the white hat on the field is final. That said, he is subject to a post game review process by the conference.
*But what about hypothetical scenario involving goal line/out of bounds?*
You have to maintain control while doing your move. Simply catching the ball is not enough, it has to be maintained through contact \(see this play\)
I'll add more as I see them come in
*Do you have more clips like this?*
Here's a video where Redding breaks down a very similar play in TAMU v. UA. Notice how the WR successfully tucks and turns under his own power before it's immediately stripped.
Here's a video in which it was called an incompletion, TAMU vs. LSU. WR never completes his act common to the game before losing control.
This is an incompletion. Steps do not matter if you don't have control.</td><td>Maybe don't steal, then. Nobody needs to steal $250 worth of food to feed themselves or their families. 
Theft is rampant in major cities. People walk in, take what they want, and walk out. In Seattle, they put cops at a local Target for a few hours and arrested 35 shoplifters in just a few hours. Despite the fact that these thefts were "organized", taking specific items that are easy to resell, nearly all were charged with misdemeanors and immediately let go because it's hard to steal $750 worth of merchandise at once. It's gotten to the point where downtown stores are locking up more and more. Even ice cream is now behind lock and key. Meanwhile, the city has for years had a roving open air drug market where you can buy all your drugs and stolen goods all in one place, which aside from the occasional raid when they need a PR win, the city just allows.
What's needed is more enforcement, especially against repeat offenders who have been arrested, convicted, and let go dozens of times.</td><td>0.041566250062897</td><td>0.6080851294910881</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: red"><td>Don't go to see *The Black Swan* with Natalie Portman, or watch any old films with Elizabeth Taylor – both lovers of the Jewish State.</td><td>Meanwhile, Israel has declared a state of war, called up their reserves, and begun a massive bombing campaign in Gaza.</td><td>Everything every BDS-hole should boycott but never will So your  organization has decided to boycott all products and services from  Israel. Here is a list of activities that you now need to perform in  order to comply with this boycott.
First,  remove all Intel Pentium and Celeron computer processor chips from  personal computers (desktops, laptops and notebooks) as these were  either developed or manufactured in Israel.
Note that the  revolutionary new Ivy Bridge processor will be manufactured in  Israel. Any computers running the Windows XT operating system must be  turned off immediately as this was developed in Israel. All current  Microsoft operating systems are not to be used as Microsoft is heavily  reliant on its Israel R&D centre.
**Step 2**.  Any computers that still work need to have their anti-virus software  and personal firewalls removed as this technology originated in Israel.  The organisation's firewall will also need to be switched off. Staff  should no longer open external emails as most of these will be infected  with viruses. No outgoing emails can be sent. The algorithm (code)  that's used today for sending e-mails, was made by an Israeli who worked  at the Ben-Gurion University in Be'er-Sheva in 1980.
**Step 3**.  Discard all mobile phones, as this technology was developed in Israel,  where the first mobile phones were manufactured. Mobile chip technology  from a single Israeli company has now been installed in over 100 million  devices. Only top-level staff may retain mobile phones for emergency  situations. However the use of SMS (Texting) is expressly forbidden as  this facility was developed in Israel. No 4G devices can be used, as the  chipset is Israeli.
**Step 4**. Turn off  your voice-mail service and delete any recorded messages. Israeli  companies invented the voice-mail system. If someone you do not know  answers your phone-call, then hang up. Israeli call-centres and  call-centre technology is in widespread operation in the UK.
**Step 5**.  Before accepting any printed material, check that the supplier has not  used the Israeli device that might have saved up to 50% of the ink used.
**Step 6**.  At home, do not use Facebook as many in-built and add-on applications  are Israeli-developed. Do not watch videos on the Internet as the  platform used to upload them may be from AOL and hence from an Israeli  company. Do not use the Internet to search for answers to your questions  as this may involve use of an Israeli-developed search engine. Better  to remain unenlightened.
**Step 7**. On your  TV or home entertainment centre, do not use Video On Demand (VOD) to  watch movies as you may inadvertently see an advert displayed  using Israeli software. Do not purchase any games devices as these are  likely to use Israeli technology.
**Step 8**.  Do not read books using an e-book as this may contain Israeli  technology. Do not use data storage as it may have been developed at  Israel's storage technology R&D center.
**Step 9**.  Do not buy an electric car as it is likely to be powered with  an Israeli battery or use Israeli developed charging mats. Continue to  sit in traffic knowing that you are polluting the environment and  financing oil-rich despotic regimes.
Turning to  food and drink, all food outlets on the organisation's premises must  dispose of cherry tomatoes, which were developed in Israel. Staff must  ensure that no cherry tomatoes are included in sandwiches brought into  office premises. The ban also applies to honey and any products derived  from honey. Israel has developed solutions to the worldwide problem of  bee-colony collapse, so that any products derived from bees might only  be available now due to an Israeli invention.
Avoid  drinking any of the world-recognized award-winning Israeli wines. Do not  consume homemade drinks from Israeli-manufactured household drinks  machines.
Avoid any fruit from South Africa or Peru as produce from these countries is being marketed with Israeli brand names.
No  agricultural products from the following areas must be consumed as they  use water irrigation and agricultural technology provided directly from  Israel. This includes most of Africa, China, India, Indonesia (a Muslim  country), Nepal and many others.
Much fruit and  vegetables (including organic) imported into the UK has been enhanced  using Israeli technology. This may save millions of people from starving  around the world, but is not a good reason for you to eat it. To be  safe, only eat fruit and vegetables that you have grown yourself using  seeds that have been in your family for generations.
Destroy  all personal medication. Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals, the largest  generic drugs company in the world, will have manufactured many of your  medicines.  Staff with the following illnesses will need to take  specific precautions.
Cancer – do not take any form of  medication or treatment. Israeli scientists have been working at the  forefront of oncology for decades.
AIDS and HIV – beware;  researchers at Israel's Weizmann Institute or Hebrew University  developed or improved AZT and Hypericin-based drugs; they have also  developed a treatment that destroys HIV-infected cells without damaging  healthy ones.
Diabetes – do not measure or inject Insulin using the devices developed by Israeli scientists.
Multiple  Sclerosis – stop taking Copaxone, one of the most efficient medicines  and the only non-interferon agent, as Teva developed it.  Don't  touch Laquinimod either.
Parkinson's – remove the  Israel-pioneered brain pacemaker to stop tremors. Discontinue Levodopa,  which reduces motor disturbances. Cease sessions that involve magnetic  cortex stimulation.
Staff with a family history of heart  disease and arteriosclerosis must not use the Israeli device for early  detection of these.  Rather, wait until onset of the disease.
Epileptics  – stop treatment that may have benefited from the Israeli discovery of  the underlying mutant gene; also throw away the bracelet that sends out  an alert when a person goes into seizure.
Staff or relatives with Age-related Macular Degeneration – remove Israeli implants that arrest the disease.
Liver disease – abandon Israeli-developed antibody immunotherapy treatments.
Emphysema – steer clear of the Israeli protein replacement therapy.
Myeloma – stop taking the drug Velcade, which was developed over a period of 30 years by scientists at Haifa.
Sleep apnea – no tests using the breakthrough Israeli device for diagnosis.
Dyslexics must not benefit from the Israeli Internet-based reading system.
Skin allergies must be treated with steroid creams only, as the new safer non-steroid alternative is Israeli.
Any  incident of stroke or head trauma or onset of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,  MS, epilepsy, glaucoma or brain tumor must avoid using any of the  Weizmann Institute's patented methods of treatment.
Before  any surgery or medical tests, check that hospital catheters have not  been protected from infection using the new plastic from Israel that  disables microorganisms. Avoid throat surgery as this may utilize  Israeli surgical lasers.
Ensure any colonoscopy or gastro  investigation does not use internal Israeli cameras such as the  Pillcam.  Never undergo surgery to install an artificial heart, as the  first artificial heart transplant took place in Israel.
Kidney  transplant patients must wait for donors of the same blood group as  only Israel's revolutionary new methods allow donors from other blood  groups.  Staff of Arab origin must not make use of the only database for  matching potential Arab donors of bone-marrow – in Israel.
In  the event of a spinal injury or disease, do not accept spinal  implants – likely to be an Israeli product or development. Heart rhythm  problems must not be solved with the Israeli-developed heart pulse  generator. All heart stents are off-limits as most of these originate  from Israeli medical companies.
Check all vaccines as many  of these have been developed in Israel.  Ensure that all X-rays do  carry a radiation risk, as the only radiation-free system is  Israeli.  Treatments derived from Stem Cell research must be avoided  as most of these are Israeli-developed.
If you or your  family are struck with a bacterial infection, do not take alternatives  to older, ineffective bacteria-resistant antibiotics, as an  Israeli discovery will have been responsible for the modern, effective  drugs. Check that any pain relief medication is not based on soya as an  Israeli doctor discovered the beneficial effect of the soya bean.
Do  not use the revolutionary new Israeli bandage that saved the life of  Arizona senator Gabriella Giffords after she was shot in the head.  If  you break a bone badly, reject any treatment that involves introducing  collagen, as this may have been manufactured from Israeli plants.
Do not protect babies and infants from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome with the Babysense system from Israel.
Do not use Epilady (or epilator) – two Israelis invented this hair removal device.
Finally, reject all major dental treatment, as your teeth may need to be scanned with an Israeli-developed dental scanner.
When  interviewing prospective new staff or holding meetings with members of  the public or with individuals from other companies, it is vital that  you check whether they originate from, or are associated with the  following countries and areas. You must ensure that you do not have any  contact with people who have benefited from Israel's aid to those  countries. The organization must avoid any possible acknowledgment of  Israel's contribution to world relief.   In addition, you must obtain a  formal statement from the government of these countries that Israeli aid  was not responsible for the production or development of any goods and  services supplied to the organization.

Peru's hydro-electric power plants are also being built and run by an Israeli company.
Rawanda, Mexico, Chad,  Sudan (Darfur) and Malawi all have received humanitarian aid from  Israel, including medical assistance from Israel's NGO IsraAID.
Always  remember that the boycott extends to any individuals from the above  regions that have been exposed to Israeli assistance during the 63 years  existence of the current Jewish State.
\-Reject  all products from the USA. Analysis conducted in a typical US  stateshows that Israeli innovations were responsible for $2.4 billion in  direct revenue to that state's economy in 2009 and generated nearly  6,000 jobs.
\-Do not tutor your children in advanced  Mathematics techniques, which may have originated in Israel. Also, if  these techniques are used in your children's schools, withdraw your  children immediately.
\-Keen ornithologists should consider  giving up their hobby as many rarespecies stop off or reside in Israel  during their twice-yearly migration.
\-Do not watch the new series of NCIS as one of the actresses is Israeli.
\-Avoid going to any football matches featuring teams with Israeli players.
\-Destroy  all your recordings of Madonna, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Deep  Purple, Bon Jovie, Justin Bieber, George Benson, Moby and many, many  more artists who have ridiculed the illogical boycott and have proudly  performed (or will shortly perform) concerts in Israel.
\-Destroy  any recordings of U2, Lady Gaga, Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, Beck,  Rihanna Coldplay and any artist whose music has been recorded using  the sound technology of the Grammy Award winning Israeli company Wave  Audio. You also must get rid of any personal copies of *Shrek*,*American Beauty* and *Star Wars*. Do not trust anything recorded by Sony, JVC, Toshiba or Dell.
\-Don't go to see *The Black Swan* with Natalie Portman, or watch any old films with Elizabeth Taylor – both lovers of the Jewish State.
\-Do not stay in hotels or visit shopping centers owned by Israeli companies (sorry, you will need to check which ones yourself).
\-Do not have anything to do with the banks who are using Israeli software to prevent fraud.
\-Do  not use any credit or debit card as the Security monitoring system used  by the credit card companies is likely to be Israeli.
\-Do not buy an engagement ring containing a diamond as it is possible that this may have been cut in Israel.
\-Do not travel by air, as your plane might get towed by the Israeli-built "Taxibot."
\-Do not use public transport inside Amsterdam, Moscow or Northern Chinain case you benefit from Israeli transportation devices.
\-If  you suffer a power or network failure, be grateful that at least you  haven't installed the Israeli system that prevents power outages.
\-Finally,  you need to leave all your taps running when you leave home and must  never flush your  toilet, because Israel provides water-saving technology to over half of  the planet. It also is providing sewage treatment technology across the  world, including to the UK. It should be obvious by now that all the  measures specified in Parts 1 – 4 of this series of blogs will  inevitably mean that your organization and your staff will be completely  unable to function.  Let's therefore hope that the decision by your  organization to boycott Israeli products is flushed down the toilet of  history.

From  1966 onward Coca-Cola has been a  staunch supporter of Israel. Recently  the Government of Israel Economic  Mission honored Coca-Cola at the  Israel Trade Award Dinner for its  continued support of Israel for the  last 30 years and for refusing to  abide by the Arab League boycott of  Israel.
NESTLE
Swiss food giant Nestle will set up a   global research and development center for snack foods next year in   Sderot, a town in Israel's Negev desert, the Maariv newspaper reported   on Sunday. Nestle owns 50.1 percent of Israeli food maker Osem   Investments and the two together produce snack foods at a plant in   Sderot.
DISNEY
The Disney Company is owned by Jewish  Mogul  Michael Eisner. He owns a vast media empire that includes the  ABC  television network, numerous news dailies, national magazines,  Hollywood  film companies and a large number of radio stations. One  radio station  in Los Angeles, KABC 790 AM recently broadcast comments  by Jewess Gloria  Alred to the effect that the Islamic prisoners at  Guantanamo should be  tortured by having their "balls" extracted with  pliers in order to make  them talk. The news and commentaries made  through Michael Eisner's media  octopus are extremely Islamophobic and  anti-Palestinian.

**I think, you need the whole world to boycott All these Israeli Products. If you can! Haha.**</td><td>This is bad. Live coverage can be found here and on Twitter. 
On top of firing 5000 rockets in a short time, Hamas vehicles were able to overrun a border checkpoint and have been driving around the Israeli border town of Sderot (population 30,000). Videos and photos show them indiscriminately shooting at civilian vehicles and taking civilian hostages on the street, along with photos of dead civilians I won't share here. Allegedly, they took over a police station and went after civilians in shelters. Reports of large numbers of civilian casualties and some kidnappings have begun to appear as well.
The commander of Hamas has called for Israeli Arab civilians (20% of the country) to rise up in armed rebellion and is also asking for support from Israel's Arab neighbor states.
 
Meanwhile, Israel has declared a state of war, called up their reserves, and begun a massive bombing campaign in Gaza. This is the most significant attack on the Israeli homeland in 50 years. Given the current government, I would expect an overwhelming response in Gaza, with boots on the ground not out of the question.</td><td>0.0415675451421857</td><td>0.6985281928325489</td><td>4</td></tr>

Edit: TL;DR at bottom
A couple years ago I was working in a discount clothing store, the kinda store that would have their own brands who looked like popular expensive brands for a fraction of the cost. Now due this we had low staff numbers, high staff turnover and archaic machines that ran on Windows 94. This also ment that we would have to do all price changes by hand and that the scan tags on the clothing didn't work half the time, including sales which happened pretty much 24/7 there. Instead we would have to figure out what the low poly image on the computer was or try and scour the store to see if we had an item.
Onto the Malicious Compliance!
We were a big target for tourists as most of our shirts were cheap and had Canada written in big letters on them, due to this I would frequently gets the bazaar barters who would bring up 50 shirts to the counter and ask because they're buying all these 5 for $10 shirts can they get some for free. After which you'd tell them no they'd buy 5 and leave the other 45 for you to fold.
But we had 1 guy that took the cake. We were having a huge blowout sale happening to get rid of our overstock on a type of shirt that didn't sell well and they were being marked down to 10 for $5. (The company really wanted them gone to the point we were told to throw them on for free) however like I said we had to do price downs by hand and due to company policy could not give them the deal until the sale adjustment was complete. So this guy walks in all bombastic sizing me and my only other co-worker up while in his cheap polyester suit, wanting to buy around 20 shirts off of the problem shirt rack. Only problem is we haven't priced them down due to lack of materials and time (busy day) so they still read $5 each (still a pretty good price for a shirt). He slams down the shirts, we greet him with the salesman smile plastered to our face, go on about is this everything ect when he cuts us off. He demands that we shut up and take his money so he get get out of and I quote: "This stank ass mall." Of course me being a decent person i try to point out the new sale and I was even going to honor it despite the lack of manners but he wouldn't have it and said: "Don't feed me your Salesman B.S. I just want my shirts and I want to leave is that too hard for your thick head to understand!"
So in classic Malicious Compliance I ring up the shirts, take his card and carefully tell him and write on his receipt No refunds (we couldn't do this on sale items anyways and as all items are on sale all the time we could never take any items back). I enjoyed his face where after the fact I put the 10 for $5 sign up on the rack he just purchased. He tried to fight it but ultimately lost after security dragged him out for trying to throw a punch at me in anger.
This one stuck out but man did this sort of stuff happen all the time at that store, thankfully I've moved on from that job and now have a comfy spot at another store with great bosses, co-workers and a functioning automatic price system.
TL;DR: Rude guy doesn't let me tell him about a sale for the items he's buying and ends up getting dragged out by security for trying to assault me.</td><td>Not tax collectors, He had one as a close disciple, and had dinner at another one's house. He threw fists at "moneychangers" who were involved in exploitative commerce within the Temple compound, forcing people to pay higher prices for spotless animals for their sacrifices. As I understand it, the purchases could only be made using Temple tokens, which had to be bought from the moneychangers.</td><td>0.041567638779847</td><td>0.8051222995973721</td><td>4</td></tr>

My work environment is less an environment and more-so a conglomeration of duct tape, spit, and cussing. I managed, among many things, a set of rentals, accounts receivable, and customer database analysis. Essentially, our company's bus factor was far too ~~high~~low.
Another important bit that I handled were various legal documents that the State requires meticulous processes to be followed, and allows for a digital or physical paper trail. I opted for digital.
Now, my boss kindly provided me a Pentium 4 dual core computer that he found at the bargain warehouse for about $40. I had the most sophisticated work station in the business, for context. This wasn't quite enough for database management and analytical software to boot up - more or less process a dataset, so I called up our IT guy.  Who worked for the boss's friend's sister-in-law's business. 200 miles away. I go, "Hey Tim! I need to add my personal laptop to the company network. Can you make that happen?"
"Sure, I'll be down to that location in a week or two. Can it wait?"
So Tim shows up. We get the boss to rubber stamp that this is all OK, and I have remote access to the servers and some annoying corporate* mandated securities on my laptop. Which, no big deal, they stay out of the way.
We didn't have anything like a software policy, either. I think some computers had Office 2007 installed, but that's clunky and makes data transfer complicated. It's the 20 teens, there's no need for that.
I do all of my work on a google drive account tied to my work email. This is great, because I can hot-swap my work station to wherever the boss wants me today. Sometimes he likes to pretend I'm a secretary and throws me in his office. Sometimes he thinks I'm a technician and puts me at a station with no computer. Whatever. Data is transient. 
Anyways. Things have been tense recently. I've moved almost all of my job to digital, and the boss thinks that means I don't work any more. Obviously, an office monkey with no papers is an office monkey with not enough work. Now, he wasn't EXACTLY wrong. I had been automating things, and was doing the job of about 6 people.
How can I do the job of 6 people without the boss knowing? Easy. He likes to manage by the seat of his pants. One day he fired a maintenance person and just "rolled" that job into the receptionist, driver, and technician jobs. One day he decided that the sales team could handle marketing - surely buying a single $2000 camera is cheaper than having a professional do shoots each week. Besides - guerilla handicam sales pitches are in vogue, it'll be great! 
Moving on, after two years of "shuffling" I had accumulated a large amount of jobs. Many of them tedious. And, with the right tools (made by me, at home, on my personal laptop that happens to be able to connect to the network), a good 4 hour job can be completed with about 10 minutes of sorting and parsing data. 
So the time comes. We all know its coming - one of the suits tipped me off that the particular suit who's payroll is wasted on chumps like me had propositioned the boss that a pair of receptionists can do the work I do, for cheaper. Just hire some college kids, work 'em each 18 hours a week, it'll be grand.
Knowing that, I backed up everything to my personal google.drive account - but of course did not delete anything from the company owned one. Like I said, the State has a vested interest in these processes, and I knew in my heart-of-hearts that the company couldn't be trusted to maintain records. I didn't want to be on the hook for that in 6 years, so I kept a copy.
I figured it would go smoothly. I'm called to the big office for a meeting. There's too many suits, my supervisor gives me some side eye. It's not a surprise. I carefully make sure to click, "Log out of all locations" on my Google account and tuck my laptop into my car before heading upstairs.
The meeting starts with the boss saying, "Well kiddo," yes, he calls me kiddo. Since I'm not 60 years old, I'm obviously a child. "Well, Kiddo, I'm sad to say that I was wrong. I shouldn't have hired you. You're fired."
Well... that was blunt. And rude. So I stand up, extend my hand across the table, and prepare to thank him for the last few years.
"NOT so fast. Sit down, we have things to discuss."
Hahaha... what? I sit down for a moment, in brief shock. The adrenaline starts to pump and my finger tips are cold. Boss begins to tell me all of things they need from me. Contacts. Account statuses. Explanation of discrepancies on AR accounts. documentation for State interests. All things that, as his competent employee, I could have printed and sitting on his desk in moments. I decide to comply with him starting the meeting by saying I'm fired. Where I live, either of us can stop the employment situation for any reason. He had legally fired me.
I counter him, "Well, Boss, I don't feel particularly comfortable accessing your network since I'm not an employee."
He exploded. Think of Karen, a millionaire Karen with little-brother syndrome who wants to be John Wayne but looks a bit too much like Smoky the Bear's fat cousin to get the role. His explosion was violent. Spit everywhere. I'll save you the details of how he stalked me to my car and demanded the employees "form a barrier".
He called me a few times. They went to voicemail as I drove to a public wifi hotspot. I carefully removed my laptop from their network. I drove home, unpacked my work lunch. My phone hasn't stopped ringing - he probably had a receptionist being paid minimum wage to hit the "redial" button.
Eventually I answer a call from his cellphone. He makes some demands. I very flippantly offer to come to work for him at 10x my rate. He yells some more. An hour later, he's pounding on my door. I don't want to deal with that, I know he carries a loaded pistol in his car (again, cowboy - emphasis on the boy). The cops escort him away and I email a copy of my security footage to the responding officer. He thanks me.
The company doesn't flounder, of course. Bossman is a millionaire, and has been very carefully losing tens of thousands of dollars a year while operating his business. He may have lost some more in the interim. 
But that's not my concern. My concern is collecting my unemployment. And wouldn't you know, I was fired a few days before fall college class selection begins. I decide to take a few master level classes - I've had my BA for awhile, might as well get some more school in on the Boss's dime. Classes go well, and I coast through spring semester by tapping into a bit of savings. And wouldn't you know it? The pandemic happens, and my unemployment benefits are extended. Guess I'll take some summer classes. And those extended benefits were at 3x the base unemployment rate? Gee wizz, guess I can take a full set of fall classes too. And then the state extended it for another 3 months at double the base? I have winter session's signup date marked on my calendar!
The bossman calls me this morning. I coyly thank him for firing me without cause a year ago, and let him know I made the Dean's list last semester. He tells me to fuck off, he called to take me up on my deal - he'll hire me at 5x my rate to give him some information. I remind him, "Wasn't the deal 10 times my rate?"
Fuck you, 5x is too much. And I only need you for an afternoon.
"Well, I've been thinking about it. My unemployment benefits run out in a week or two. So I'll do it. I'll contract for you. I want 20x what I was making. 40 hours minimum. Paid in advance. Oh, and written scope of work - I'm only doing the work you say you need done during negotiations."
Fuck you, I'll give you 5 times and a day of work and that's final.
"No, thanks Boss. I have to get back to the classes you're paying for. Thanks again!"
I hang up. He calls back an hour later, just moments before I started writing this, actually. It's actually his daughter, the comptroller of the company. She says she spoke some reason to the boss. He'll hire me at 20x my rate for 40 hours of work, half paid up front.
Fine. she starts telling me what needs done. Turns out, they're failing a State audit quite badly. Like, "Boss is not a millionaire if this isn't fixed" kind of badly. They have all the information they need, of course - it's on my company email account's google drive.  I'm not going to tell them this. Once he pays me for half a year's work, I'll gladly spend the hour or so of time it takes to transfer all of the data he needs to a flash drive, wait until Monday of next week, and then hand it to his receptionist.
Really, the man couldn't have been nicer. He's already covered me going to college full time for over a year, and is about to cover another two semesters. I should buy him a cake.
**Edit / Update:** I got a call. They seem to have decided that the daughter/comptroller would be the best point of contact, which is fine with me. We got along fine, she has a nice kid that used to run around the office. It seems like the bulk of the issue is the information that they can't find. That's roughly zero work. But since they can't find that information at all, auditors are nitpicking very fine details that my replacements have bungled up. From the way she told it, it sounds like a nightmare. The literal end of times. Honestly it sounds like a solid day of work running through their server with some of my tools. Maybe two days. She wants me to start ASAP while they finalize writing up a contract. I gave a surprised, "Heh" of a chuckle and said no dice. Contract first, and I'll have them pass the audit perfectly, like I always used to.
I work fast.
"You don't understand, we only have until the end of the month. This needs started on today."
I work fast, and it sounds like you should hire someone who knows how to write contracts fast, too.
Sounds like a plan, good night.
edit 2: I'll do a final update once everything is settled, per the subreddit rules. The ending won't be as glamorous, but it will be an ending.</td><td>And also, you have to be at least 25 most of the time to be allowed to be added.
I worked for an orange stripey rental car company in the mid-90s. I wasn't yet 20, so even as an employee I could not rent, but I could drive the cars when we had meetings at HQ 2 hours away (and around town to fuel up or wash). Anyway, we had a special deal with the national lab in our little town, a special rate, and also if you were on lab business you could be 21 to rent. But if it was personal, even as a lab employee, you had to be 25, but you still got a discounted rate.
Lady rents a Toy Turd, er, Toyota Tercel from us for the weekend. She added no additional drivers to the contract, got the lab employee personal rate, don't remember what if any coverage from us. She had her teenage daughter with her, and we made it clear she couldn't drive it.
A couple days later, we had to bring up a couple of drivers from our location about an hour away, to help deal with an accident with one of our cars. Turns out it was this lady's car. She decided to let her daughter's boyfriend drive the thing, probably with the daughter along for the ride. He drove along a mountainous back road (well-maintained state highway, but through some back-roads type areas just outside of town), came upon an elk in the road, swerved to avoid it, caught the tire in the little gutter at the edge of the road, and flipped the car.
I had to go take a look at it at the tow yard, to help prepare it for moving to our main service center at HQ, and it was just rekt. Glass everywhere, battery burst, roof all rolled up, the whole bit. Car was worth about $10k new, the boyfriend did roughly $13k damage to it. It could not have gone well for the woman whose name was on the contract.</td><td>0.0415689001903718</td><td>0.6096578168786904</td><td>4</td></tr>

I went into work this morning and sorted through my emails, nothing about a new employee.
I see $VP in the hallway walking out of the conference room.
$VP: Hey $ME, how was your day off? The new employee is in there have you had a chance to set
up the PC yet?
$ME: No, I just got in and $CEO never sent me any of the information, and I just got in about
30 minutes ago was just sorting out my morning.
$VP: No worries, $CEO or myself will send it to you shortly.
I grab my coffee and go back to working on my list of 20 things.
$CEO: $ME, have you finished the new employees PC, he finished up with all his paperwork and
the tour of the new building he is ready to get to work.
$ME: Noone sent me the filled out form, I said yesterday if you could get it to me I would have it done today even though we have the 3-day policy in place, but without a name, I can't exactly fill out his information.
$ME: I need a full name, not just a generic first name, without that, I can't make his AD account
and he won't have an email address. I am not going to give him just a local account on a PC.
$CEO: Figure it out then, all I know is I need this PC done now for him, otherwise he is
sitting here getting paid for nothing.
So I went ahead and created an account for someone without a name, I created an account for "Mike Doe" and until I get a filled out form or someone tells me his last name, he will now be Mike Doe in my records.
TLDR-CEO hired someone and expected a PC set up right away, without a full name for me to make
credentials.</td><td>Trust me: the internet knows your IP address. The internet *must* know your IP address, in order for it to be able to send you the data that you request when you pull up a web page or fetch your email. If the internet *didn't* know your IP address, you won't get any cat videos.
Furthermore, "your" IP address *doesn't belong to you*, plus it changes periodically. It belongs to the ISP that you get your internet service from; they just lease it out to you.
So, what you want to do is use a dynamic DNS service, or DDNS, something like No-IP or Dyn. You'll set up an account with one of those services, pick a domain name, then run a small program on your server which will update that domain name with the IP address currently assigned to your router (it's likely that your router has the capability built into it, so you wouldn't need to install anything anywhere else). Also, forward the ports in your router necessary for them to connect to your Minecraft server.
Now, you just tell your Minecraft friends to connect to your server at myminecraftserver.dynamicdnsservice.tld (don't use that, because it's fake; replace it with your actual dynamic domain name). They can technically still get your IP address, but *that doesn't matter*. And at this point, all they could do with the IP address is exactly what they can do with your DDNS domain name: connect to your Minecraft server, and maybe run a port scan, which at this point would only show the Minecraft server.
BTW, having an IP address *does not* give anyone your exact location. The *best* it can do is show that you use a specific ISP and are located somewhere within a couple hundred square miles of the address on record for that ISP's local office. And for some ISPs, they don't associate IP addresses with specific office locations, so your IP address might locate you to a spot thousands of miles away from your actual geographical location, i.e. the headquarters office of the ISP.</td><td>0.041569823524534</td><td>0.7952683360597773</td><td>4</td></tr>

Yesterday, after seeing this story, I attempted to enable end-to-end encryption between the camera and my phone, which would block Ring and law enforcement from seeing the camera live or any recordings.
Ring makes this intentionally hard to find and difficult to do. There are 3 steps buried deep in a menu in the app. Eventually, they generate a 9-word passphrase that's about 50 characters long. They advise storing this in a password manager, but they do not allow copying it to the clipboard (at least from the Android app). Therefore, you have to manually retype 50 characters. I screenshotted it, retyped it elsewhere, and attempted to reproduce it as required, but the app said the phrase was wrong. After checking it about 5 times, I gave up. Hanlon's Razor aside, burying the feature this much and requiring users to manually retype 50 characters instead of allowing the clipboard has to be intentional to discourage the use of this feature.
The steps I tried to follow are here. If others find an easier way to make this work, I'd love to hear it.
Edit: took another crack at this by typing on a PC and was able to get the thing enrolled in E2E encryption. But enabling this turns off basically all of the useful features of being on Ring (motion notifications, video pre-roll, shared links, event timeline, and about a dozen others). Why bother having a Ring at that point?</td><td>0.0971073692962156</td><td>0.6661232805278801</td><td>5</td></tr>

This sounds like a single-thread application with direct-to-screen output control.

By tossing a few pixels onto another screen instead of a full column of symbols (I don't really know what you mean exactly), the application has to render itself or a significant portion twice.

Your husband is trying to protect his new family from one who clearly wants to cause damage to it, if not outright destruction (i.e. your mother). You and hubby are a team now -- stick together no matter what she tries to do. Your husband is revealing his shiny spine and is trying to do his job to protect you from JNMom's machinations -- put on your sunglasses and hang on, cuz it's going to be a helluva ride.
> I feel like she's saying "I know you're going to get divorced one day, but don't worry, I'll be here for you when that happens."
That's *exactly* what she's saying, and even hoping for. Worst case, *she'll try to bring that prophecy to fulfillment* through her manipulations, just to maintain her control over you. She will try to pit you against hubby; *do not fall into the trap*. You say you don't want to rock the boat. It's understandable, but you *need* to flip that boat over and *throw her out of it*. Do everything you and hubby can to get out of her house and into your own place as quickly as possible. You're freaking out and mad at hubby, even though you agree in principle with what he said.  That's what *she* wants, though -- you angry at *him* instead of *her* over what *she* did wrong. *That's the trap*. Let your anger at him subside, because he did what was necessary at the moment. Your husband is not the enemy here; he's your greatest ally. I think you know that, but years of indoctrination from the *real* enemy have you reacting knee-jerk. Suppress the brainwashing and look at it rationally.
Set those boundaries, set clear penalties, and *stick to them*. If you have trouble doing it, let your husband run interference -- it seems like he's already getting into the battle here, and I think he's up to the task. Until you're strong enough to get all the way out of the FOG, let him be the bad guy (as far as mom is concerned), but don't let him do it alone; *stick with him* -- he's going to need your support. Don't let your mom tear the two of you apart.
> EDIT: I did confront her after the rent thing to let her know I thought we had agreed on just utilities, and she did back down, but it was in that moment we realized some weird dynamics were at play.
Excellent! You stood to her up in a relatively simple matter, and *you won*. Let that build some confidence in yourself. You also begin to see how things are going to start playing out, so be prepared for bigger and harder battles. Take it one battle at a time, one day at a time, and let hubby help -- that's one of the things we husbands are there for in our marriages. Don't get complacent -- get ready for the next encounter.
I'll echo what others have already said -- get some counseling to help you clear the FOG. And above all else, *talk with your husband*. He is there for you, just as much as you are there for him. He seems to have the strength you need right now to get clear -- use it, and eventually you will have your own strength and the confidence to use it.
I know that science-fiction is not everyone's cup of tea, and especially not Star Trek. But there's an episode of Deep Space Nine that I think is worth a watch (season 6, episode 7, "You Are Cordially Invited") -- Worf and Jadzia's wedding ceremony in the last few minutes of the episode. I think it shows a picture of what you and your new husband need to be in your current situation -- a united force fighting against all who would destroy you (i.e. your mother and any flying monkeys she sends your way), watching each other's backs, and picking each other up when something knocks you or hubby down. This *will* be a battle, and you need to be ready to fight it. You have already noticed the problems, and you agree with what hubby wrote. You just need the confidence in both him and the two of you together, and the strength to break through a lifetime of mom's programming.</td><td>0.0971100916327726</td><td>0.6234192251667126</td><td>5</td></tr>

I was curious as to if anyone else here has ever done such a good job at a company, that the company felt they were no longer needed because everything always works and there are very few pr minor issues happening?
I also ask because when i first started my job here, there were fires to put out every day. The question every day was "what are we fixing today". And according to staff, this was the norm for many years. They havent had their systems consistantly work for years. 
Over the course of the past 2 years ive been here, i have fixed many problems and was able to make it so people are no longer asking "what is going to break today", and they can confidently do their job. However, i have found that i am not doing as much work as i used to now. Half of the day is making sure everything is still working fine, or coming up with new ideas/projects to work on for improvements, and the other half of the day is just studying and researching because there really isnt too much else that i can do. And this is unfortunate because all of that work and research nobody can trace or see that i am doing it, they can only assume. Or for the worse, assume im not doing it.
I realized that, to the everyday staff worker, i went from always walking around helping people and always being seen, to basically being a hermit who never has to leave his office.

Actually, this isn't surprising at all. When configuring iMail on your iPhone or Laptop, you may notice that security is off by default. So you just go ahead and configure it correctly, right?

This piece is published in the most influential newspaper in the US, arguing that conservatives are taking lessons from 19th century slaveholders and using Texas's SB8 as a test case for their vision of "subjugating" women, minorities, and liberals.
The author eventually clarifies that his envisioned "civil war" will not be a bloody battle, but his view of the stakes is still quite clear.
> The civil war I see is not the kind that would leave hundreds of thousands of young men dead in combat. That is not to say that we aren't seeing spats of violence but rather that this new war will be fought in courts, statehouses and ballot boxes, rather than in the fields.
And this war won't be only about the subjugation of Black people but also about the subjugation of all who challenge the white racist patriarchy.
I found this passage interesting as well:
> Can they make the case that all that the Constitution has not explicitly spelled out should be reserved for the states?
The author has pasted almost verbatim the 10th amendment and implies that the states are being novel or harmful in their belief that it exists.
Overall, I find this piece horribly distasteful and divisive. The author wants the NYT's liberal base to believe that conservatives take their inspiration from slaveholders and want to "subjugate" them. From a group that claims to deplore violent rhetoric, declaring war on the other side (or claiming the other side will wage war against you) seems unhelpful to the level of discourse.</td><td>0.0971183206538972</td><td>0.7030092875583138</td><td>5</td></tr>

Not saying whether that's true or not, but Canada's system is far from perfect.

Conservatives received 34% of the vote compared to 33% for the liberals. However, liberals got 46% of the seats compared to 36% for the conservatives.

Reader, plz don't be like that
So for a bit of context I live on a relatively busy road near a big shopping centre. So there are lots of people around. I also am on mobile so hate me y'all or whatever. 
EP: extreme potato 
Me: mindless entity
So I was working in my garage sorting things out (with my dad) I look around randomly as you do when... 
Enter EP with a loud screech of tyres and a bang. 
EP: SHITTTT! (no joke she said that through her open car window)
So Ep has gone and smashed into 2 separate parked cars knocking one half onto the sidewalk and removing the side mirror. The other car suffered minor damage but who cares. At this point the Ep has gotten out of her car and is busily on the phone. (Strange that she dialled so quickly?) and checking our the damage on her car. It was a big four wheel drive so wasn't damaged badly. After inspecting her car and ignoring her kid who she had in the back (about 3-4) she walks off to the cars she hit, seems normal right? WRONG, she proceeded to yell for the owners of the CRASHED CARS to come and apologise? Now these people are clearly not there and the Em is getting angry by the minute.
P: is there a problem?
P: no but you have left your kid in your ca..
P: I said nothing like that.
Me: no he was just trying to help, stop yelling.
Me and p exchange confused looks.
Fast forward a few minutes the cops actually arrive, surprisingly.
O: what seems to be the problem.
Em: these two crashed into my car and are refusing to give me their details.
EM: pay for my car, now
O: please give this lady your details.
Me: no, firstly you crashed into those cars and second, I am under a he age to legally drive.
Em: arrest him for driving without a license!
Em: hurry up my K needs to go to her swimming lessons.
Note: I'm skinny, and definitely not black. Though I have South American heritage.
O: lady stop screaming or I will arrest you for wasting police time.
(Officer turns to p and me) O: sorry about all this folks please go about your day.
At this point the Em is pale and scared. Then she does the stupidest thing.
Em was later arrested for resisting arrest and also for attempted fraud trying to get us to pay for her car. Of which I found out later was not hers as she was borrowing it and that it also wasn't insured.  
To me this is just a new level of stupidity.
Also this is my first time posting so any advice is appreciated.

As people who worked in this particular sector of call center work would know, when an issue of safety comes up, the employees taking calls are given special instructions on how to quickly make sure CX is okay, then immediately escalate the call to Tier 2. 
Get a call one day from a woman who says her computer is overheating. I immediately ask if she's okay and safe and she assures me she's fine, and there is no present danger. So I proceed to tell her I'll have to escalate the call, I'll just need a little info from the computer. I get the info, put her on hold, and call our Tier 2. After getting the agents name, I patch the call together and begin to introduce the agent to CX. I'm immediately interrupted by the customer yelling "HOLD ON!" followed by some rustling. The Tier 2 agent pauses for a moment before saying "Ma'am are you okay?" More rustling and then a whooshing sound in the background (our headsets are pretty crappy so it was hard to tell what was happening exactly) Few moments later the woman comes back and says "Sorry, had to get the FIRE EXTINGUISHER" Agent immediately asks if we need to call the authorities. Woman proceeds to tell us "No I'm fine, the table was just on FIRE" Agent asks what caused it, CX replies " the computer, it was smoking when I called in, that's why I called, wanted to see if you could fix it OVER THE PHONE" At this point the Tier 2 kicked me from the call to take care of the customer.

Get to the hotel, and not only did they not have my reservation, but they were also completely booked for that night. My boss had used Expedia to make all the travel arrangements (as he did regularly), but Expedia hadn't sent the reservation to the hotel. I was at the right place, but Expedia screwed up.
I called my boss (who was 3 hours ahead), I called Expedia, my boss called Expedia, Expedia called the hotel and tried to get a room. They harangued the hotel staff for at least an hour, but there was nothing available short of conjuring a room out of thin air or throwing a bed and a shower into a broom closet. While one of the young ladies at the desk was dealing with Expedia, the other was calling other nearby hotels to see if they had any vacancies. Thankfully, she found one about 6 blocks away. I was able to sink the cost of 2 nights @ $220/night and get reimbursed later, the other lady finally convinced Expedia that there was nothing else they could do, my boss got his reservation money back, and I did the job and got back home.
I wrote a letter the following week to the first hotel thanking both ladies for their help dealing with Expedia's screwup and helping me get a room elsewhere.</td><td>0.0971307528518197</td><td>0.6885877812463751</td><td>5</td></tr>

Racism used to have a simple definition: the belief that one race is superior to another, leading to discrimination. Now, it also means something else. The dictionaries have literally been changed. By this definition, **any disparity in outcomes is racist**, even if no explicit bias or discrimination is involved. Conversely, any policy or action that makes outcomes more equal is "anti-racist", even if it is explicitly discriminatory against whites. Further, they state that any person or policy that is not explicitly anti-racist is racist. This is how you end up with people stating things like "only white people can be racist because racism requires power".
One of the most visible proponents of this view is a Boston professor and author named Ibram X Kendi. Here are some excerpts from his bestselling book (source 1, source 2). Apologies for the long quotes, but I want to give appropriate context:
> The opposite of "racist" isn't "not-racist." It is "anti-racist." ... There is no in between safe space of "not racist." The claim of "not racist" neutrality is a mask for racism... The common idea of claiming "color blindness" is akin to the notion of being "not racist"—as with the "not racist," the color-blind individual, by ostensibly failing to see race, fails to see racism and falls into racist passivity. **The language of color blindness—like the language of "not racist"—is a mask to hide racism**...
> A racist policy is any measure that produces or sustains racial inequity between racial groups. An antiracist policy is any measure that produces or sustains racial equity between racial groups. By policy, I mean written and unwritten laws, rules, procedures, processes, regulations, and guidelines that govern people. **There is no such thing as a nonracist or race-neutral policy.** Every policy in every institution in every community in every nation is producing or sustaining either racial inequity or equity between racial groups...
> The defining question is whether the discrimination is creating equity or inequity. If discrimination is creating equity, then it is antiracist. If discrimination is creating inequity, then it is racist. ... **The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination**. The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.
This guy is not some loon. He is widely listened to and these definitions are the basis of how race is taught in corporate diversity trainings and college campuses. The common parlance is now that any inequity of outcomes is oppression and systemic racism. A definition that literally wasn't in the dictionary 5 years ago is now the truth, and questioning it or wanting to be "race-neutral" in your approach to the issue is racist. This is how you end up with policies like states giving preferential vaccine access based on race. MLK's values of "judging people by the content of their character, not the color of their skin" might be considered racist by some today.

Her response didn't seem thrilled or positive. Where did I go wrong? Did I?
As of today my Wife and I have been married for 4 years. I hold no hesitation in saying that it hasn't always been easy, but we've teamed up and gotten here all the same. Between life as it happens, unraveling and healing past trauma, differences in attachment styles, and modes of thinking; we (in our mutual opinion) have to work pretty hard to keep at our best. Despite our failures, we really do try. It's a bittersweet anniversary for me because not only is my wife out of town for the month (Work) but as also 13 weeks into carrying our first baby. Something we're both really excited (scared, ecstatic, anxious, etc etc.) about.
I've been working on our house/yard a lot this week with her out of town. I work on the house/yard a lot in general. I'm fairly skilled with tools and pretty capable in the Construction/DIY Department. So, though we work together on things sometimes, I take on the lion share of that responsibility to our home. I enjoy it. Today when we talked on the phone She asked what I was doing with my day and I responded (I thought playfully) with "You know, doing what I do best!" and her response was "Puttering around the house and playing on your computer?" - I admittedly got a little defensive and asked "Is that what I do best?". The conversation got a little awkward from there, nothing much else said and we ended it with the 'love you's' etc. I tried to go on with the day, but I felt it, her response struck a nerve. Admittedly, "puttering" around the house and playing on my computer ARE two things I enjoy when there's no real work to be done at the moment. She probably \[obviously?\] feels like I do it a lot. In that moment, I just couldn't help but feel unappreciated. I do work really hard on our home in much of my spare time.
Things have been a little extra strained with us lately with the baby coming. New joys, new fears, new things to bond over and have conflict over. We're getting by, but emotions have been running high...for both of us.
Rather than try and push the feeling away or otherwise invalidate it, I called her back and told her that our last conversation left me feeling down. I explained that I didn't think she was saying anything to be mean\[in fact was probably just being playful\], and that I knew it was ME experiencing a moment of insecurity....and asked for her help by (as an anniversary gift) making me a list of ten things she appreciates about me and feels like I'm the best at. She agreed to it, but her response was...unenthused.....begrudging? and I feel lost and puzzled by it. My words were kind, I didn't make blame or lay guilt, and I felt like my tone of voice was appropriately soft, and undemanding. And to be clear, she DID say she could/would do that....but said it in that 'I don't like what was just asked me of' kind of tone.
I'm reaching out here for feedback and thoughts from the community. Fully understanding that none of you (I'm pretty sure) are my wife and therefore can't be in her head. But any insight into the response or feedback on how I could/should have approached things differently would be really appreciated.

>**Q:** Hey **Mr. X,** we're having some internet troubles here at the office, so I'm postponing with **\[NEW EMPLOYEE\]** until it's back up and running. I'm going to call her and go over what I can over the phone that doesn't require me to remote in or to show her anything  
>**X:** Will she be ready and through the training in the next hour and a half?  
>**X:** **Q**, I have to say I'm a little annoyed. **\[NEW EMPLOYEE\]** reports that you had another client during her training time, then you had network issues and were going to call her back, then never called her back. So now she's not trained for our meeting today so now my time is going to be wasted.  
>**Q:** I did have a client this morning and when it started to run long I let her know that it was running long and I would be a little delayed. I come into the office and **\[NET PROVIDER\]** is working on the lines right now which pretty much eliminates anything involving remote work. I had asked her for her phone number so that way I could call her Direct, but **\[NET PROVIDER\]** who is also my cell phone company, wasn't allowing access to 4G and I did not get the phone number until right about an hour ago. I'm very sorry that this happened, but understand all of it was out of my control  
>**X:** A word of advice in business, **Q**: nobody really cares about excuses. I hear your story but it doesn't affect anything from my end. What I see here is that your meeting ran long and there were some tech issues. In no other work environment other than mine would that be acceptable in any way shape or form. I could ask why you didn't go to a Starbucks. Or call from a landline. Or use your home internet. I never could have built my business if I had let little things like this get in the way of my ability to deliver results. You shouldn't either.
*Note:* He straight up asks why I can't ***go to Starbucks or go home***. I don't know, maybe because I have, like, a job? And our landline is a VOIP by the way as many are. Not to mention, my home net and the Starbucks here use the same provider we do...and they were out. The nearest Starbucks that doesn't use our provider is 45 minutes from the office. Yes, I'm in a small town.
>**Q:** To update you on yesterday, **\[NET PROVIDER\]** experienced an attack. They had to shut down many their connections they deemed relevant. I assume since we bounce internationally on a VPN, we were deemed relevant. I just checked it at the office this morning it's back up and running  
>**X:** Clarifying an excuse doesn't make it somehow matter. Excuses still don't matter to anybody. That said, I'm glad you're up and running.</td><td>Trustworthy?

Oil and whale blubber are not remotely comparable.  Whale blubber was used to read at night.  Our entire civilization runs on oil.  Our relationship to oil is more comparable to the Irish relationship with the potato circa 1844.

"The Market" cannot produce energy, only different ways to harness available energy.  The problem is that we use such a gargantuan quantity of fossil energy it seems there is nothing known to physics that can feasibly replace it.  All the commercially produced biomass in the US could not replace our gasoline consumption.  Uranium and coal are in much shorter supply than is popularly supposed.  As you work your way down the list of ways to replace oil everything comes up way too short.

Aside from the limited potential of substitutes to match current consumption, we also face the problem that as oil reaches price points where the substitutes become viable we will be much poorer and perhaps unable to afford the development investments.

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>Edit: okay guys, I hear you, you think it was a bear.</td><td>I agree, that is why I'm putting more emphasis on the supervisor.</td><td>My friends and  I went canoe camping in a new provincial park.  We had this neat trip planned, we'd get flown into the middle of the park with out canoes, and canoe our way out over the course of a week.
First night, everything is pretty normal and cool.  Next day, we go over to the head of a trail up a mountain. (Mountain is a little bit of a misnomer, it's Ontario so our mountains are pretty small).  The base of the trail is in a campsite.  We get out of our canoes, and go up into the campsite to find the trail.
The campsite is a wreck.  Like, clothes tossed all around in the mud.  A dehydrated meal, that someone clearly hacked into with a knife, barely eaten.  Snack wrappers and trash.  A couple pairs of shoes.  Three different tarps, torn down and muddy.  A sleeping bag, I think.  Thing you wouldn't expect to be left behind, even with the messiest of campers.  No sign of anyone around (but plenty of evidence there had been at least 3-5 people here).  No sign of a canoe.  Keep in mind, this is a lake you can ONLY access via several days of canoing/hiking or a plane.  
To this day, we don't know what happened there.  It was a week before we got out of the park ourselves (and we were in a rough state when we did, it was a very rainy trip) so we never really found out what had happened.  Some members of our party said that they saw a canoe at the site the previous night (because they'd wanted that site, and it had been occupied.) but we woke up hella early and didn't see anything leave.  Our best guess is still that someone had an emergency (maybe hypothermia.  It was real rainy), they'd called out for an emergency rescue, and in their haste left behind a lot of stuff.
Edit: okay guys, I hear you, you think it was a bear.  I highly doubt it, and here's why:
- No tracks.  This is the big one
- The campsite was missing a lot of the essential things.  Like tents and packs.  They clearly had time to pack up *some* gear.
- There was a lot of partially eaten food out.  The dehydrated meal still had a spoon in it, and it had been opened in a way to make a bowl.  Bears don't have that much dexterity.  There was baggies of trail mix, still sealed.
- The mess was *very* human.  There were clothes that had been laid near the fire or over logs, and the shoes were also set up to dry.</td><td>I agree, that is why I'm putting more emphasis on the supervisor.

I worked in a bank's back office of over a decade. Towards the end of my stay there, we got detached from one department and moved to another during a general restructure.
While there, we get talked down on and called stuck up and unfriendly. Mind you, because of compliance, we sit in a secure environment that allows little interaction to non-staff of the unit. As a result of some beef the head has with us, stemming from not understanding our duties, we got a new unit head who came in with the same attitude saying we were blowing our jobs out of proportion and that the general opinion is we were lazy.
She wanted to be copied in every mail we sent out as well as receive all our standard operating procedures etc.
The thing is, in out unit we had like 5 subunits and she had no <URL> one had asked us for a structure or our job descriptions, they all came with preconceived notions about us.
I was tasked with sending the procedures,work manuals, job descriptions, and team strength. We shared all our unit email passwords and that's when it starts to dawn on her when she saw 1 mailbox having over 500 emails and only 3 people attending.
Then we started copying her in our mails. In a day we get no less than 200 mails and send more than that, and that's 1 sub unit only. So she got copied in everything. Every single mail from 5 subunits. 
In 3 days she came running, asking us to include her in escalations and relevant mails only. My colleagues,ever mischievous, turned a deaf ear.
We continued to copy her for about 3 weeks and even included her in automated responses. She missed her own relevant mails cos her box would be filled with over 1000 mails.
After a month, she sent someone to *plead* that we stop, which we did, somewhat. She opted to be removed from the unit head position after that and gave the dept head a report.

The internet *must* know your IP address, in order for it to be able to send you the data that you request when you pull up a web page or fetch your email. If the internet *didn't* know your IP address, you won't get any cat videos.
Furthermore, "your" IP address *doesn't belong to you*, plus it changes periodically. It belongs to the ISP that you get your internet service from; they just lease it out to you.
So, what you want to do is use a dynamic DNS service, or DDNS, something like No-IP or Dyn. You'll set up an account with one of those services, pick a domain name, then run a small program on your server which will update that domain name with the IP address currently assigned to your router (it's likely that your router has the capability built into it, so you wouldn't need to install anything anywhere else). Also, forward the ports in your router necessary for them to connect to your Minecraft server.
Now, you just tell your Minecraft friends to connect to your server at myminecraftserver.dynamicdnsservice.tld (don't use that, because it's fake; replace it with your actual dynamic domain name). They can technically still get your IP address, but *that doesn't matter*. And at this point, all they could do with the IP address is exactly what they can do with your DDNS domain name: connect to your Minecraft server, and maybe run a port scan, which at this point would only show the Minecraft server.
BTW, having an IP address *does not* give anyone your exact location. The *best* it can do is show that you use a specific ISP and are located somewhere within a couple hundred square miles of the address on record for that ISP's local office. And for some ISPs, they don't associate IP addresses with specific office locations, so your IP address might locate you to a spot thousands of miles away from your actual geographical location, i.e. the headquarters office of the ISP.</td><td>0.0686410495367311</td><td>0.7588657550004927</td><td>5</td></tr>

I've told employers about my autism, but the reality is that very few of them understand what that means.  There are many who will pity you, and still others that will simply count that as a strike against you and the reason you'll never "fit."  Very few will understand it or seek to learn more about it.  That even applies in my field of IT, where an awful lot of what gets done and gets created is done by people who are autistic!
Over time I have learned to avoid those kinds of jobs that I know I'm just not going to be good at - and yes, customer service types of jobs are definitely something I'd avoid.  For many years I continued to take jobs because I wanted/needed the money or saw them as a path to something better, but ended up leaving or getting fired because I couldn't "fit."  Eventually, I decided to quit ramming my head against that wall and learn to take jobs where I thought I had a better chance of being successful.

Now this happened a few years ago. While I was slowly packing up my things to go home an executive I've never spoken to for more than a few minutes comes up to me and says that he has a problem with email syncing and the support won't help. I ask about it and feel bad for the guy, literally all he does all day is answer emails and IT is trying to force him to use a shit email client. He also lists what he's tried to do to fix the problem himself and it all seems extremely reasonable. He clearly is not computer illiterate. So I do some googling, stay in 30 minutes after my time ends and fix it.
Next day I had a 6 pack on my desk when I came in with a thank you note on it. A few weeks later I got an email from HR saying that due to executive decision I've received a raise for going above and beyond and to sign the updated contract.

I'm working for a strange consulting firm that still isn't sure what to do with me, but the pay's good.  
  
   
  
After the [previous] gig, I'm told to get myself to a suburban office park somewhere in Missouri and join an existing engagement with Amalgamated Pipelines (AP).  
  
  
  
It's late Spring, so business travel becomes an excuse to ride my motorcycle. A day and a half later, I'm at my second home- a mid-grade hotel chain with the amenities I want- room service, a small hotel bar with a familiar point of sale system.  
  
  
I check in, clean up and park myself at the bar, which is sparsely occupied. I drop my laptop at the bar and start reading through the documents from the client as well as previous emails.  
   
  
Looks like Amalgamated has decided to assess and fix their cybersecurity in a few weeks, like cleaning up from a week long house-party fifteen minutes before Mom & Dad come home.  
  
  
I've been tasked with writing an entire policy kit this week. There's an external team doing some kind of vulnerabilty scan, but I'm not involved. My firm is also doing some consulting around restructuring financial stuff, but I skip over those threads.  
  
  
I find the docs I am interested in- network and infrastructure. Their regular IT network looks like late 90's state of the art- MPLS WANs between offices. The Industrial Control Systems (ICS) networks are much less detailed- the top level diagram of the whole network looks like marketing material- it's not a hastily pushed together Visio doc, but without specifics. There's some spreadsheet as an inventory- devices and locations and 172.16.x.x addresses.  
   
  
Ok. I do notice that they've handed over _nothing_ for the usual policies & procedures. I'll just buy one of those off the shelf policy kits and get AP to let me know what they don't, can't or won't do.  
   
  
It's imperfect, but that's what you get when you only have a week.  
   
  
A few more people find their way to the hotel bar, and we're all living the same life. Laptops and drinks. I notice one laptop across the bar from me with a variety of hacker conference stickers. The owner is a 30 something woman picking at a plate of fries and pipetting drops of water into a glass of scotch while staring at her screen.  
  
  
I go back to my room and slap together some slides describing my part of this project for tomorrow's kickoff and go to bed.  
  
  
The next morning, I boil water with the in-room coffee maker to make oatmeal, and make it to Amalgamated's offices.  
  
  
I get to meet the teams. My firm has a handful of management consultants, but I'm the only IT or security consultant. There's another firm doing a pentest. After the initial kickoff meeting, I'll get to try to coordinate with the handful of people I need to talk to. I'd expect to overlap with the pentest team to save time.  
  
  
Right as the meeting starts, I see the Scotch-drinking woman from the bar and her bestickered laptop. There are intros and a lot of backstory about Amalgamated. I really don't care, but I want to look attentive and easy to work with.  
  
  
After the meeting, I meet Ralph, Amalgamated's Director of IT. He wants to make sure I  get settled in. I follow him through a maze of mouse-colored cubicles. I think I'm in a sales or customer service phone bank as the people around me are busy taking short phone calls. Ralph has a neutral American accent, which makes me guess he's either from Central Ohio or he's suppressing a thicker accent.  
   
  
This distracts me. I want to force him to say "to be" or "needs done" and solve this mystery. After some chit-chat in his office, we agree on the plan- I'm going to give him parts of the generic policy and he'll assign Amalgamated staff to make comments. Once we collect all their inputs, I'll edit the policies and they can sign off on them. The next week will be spent poking people, fighting over wording and writing.  
   
  
Policy writing ain't easy but it's necessary. I'll be chasing stakeholders like Tom chased Jerry.  
  
  
The first day, it's sending emails and editing the policy template. I'm mostly changing names, titles and commenting out things Amalgamated doesn't handle, like credit cards or healthcare data. This isn't complicated work, so I get to take in my surroundings. Most of the people at Amalgamated have worked here for years. Their cubes are decorated with plaques showing how long they've been there. During coffee breaks, I wander around to see many five and ten year plaques of different colors. I'll have to ask Ralph when I talk to him next.  
  
  
Most of the office empties out at 4:55, but one woman in a cube near me sticks around.  
  
  
I try listening into her calls. Maybe she's renting real estate on the side. Her calls start out with narrowing down a particular property and then telling them either "you're OK" or "we'll be out there within 48 hours. Don't do any work in the area until we're there".  
  
  
Fine. I've done my day's work, so I leave Amalgamated. The parking lot's empty, so I deliberately ride over the speed bumps fast enough to catch air.  
  
  
Simple pleasures, like a dinner at Waffle House and a book. I ride back to the hotel and park myself in the bar to have a drink and catch up on other work.  
   
  
After a beer or two and some timesheets, I notice Scotch & Water at the bar. I wave to her and manage a brief conversation:  
  
  
me:"Hey- I saw you at the kickoff- looking at your stickers, you're on the pentest?"  
  
  
  
  
me:"Great. I'm writing policies this week. Did you get any details on their ICS systems? All I saw was marketing material"  
  
  
  
  
me:"I'd like to believe that, but I'd like to believe a lot of things that aren't true"  
  
  
  
  
I leave her be, finish my drink and go up to my room.  
  
  
Oddly enough, I've already received some comments on my drafts. Most of them are the usual- changes for people's titles, nitpicky comments on wording.  
  
  
And an odd one. In the Network Security Policy, there was a section that read like it was from the early 90's:  
  
  
  
  
"Any system with a dial-up connection shall use an unique password before being connected to the telephone network"  
  
  
I figured this wasn't relevant, so I commented with a terse:"I'm pretty sure you're not using dialup any more, so I'd suggest removing this or limiting it to fax/multifunction printers"  
  
  
This seems to be a controversial topic. This has sparked an entire back and forth between a few Amalgamated staff which comes to a conclusion that the Industrial Control Systems team can't meet this for all their dial-up systems and that it's overly burdensome to fix.  
  
  
This keeps me up at night. What sort of stuff do they have on dialup?  
  
  
The next morning, I get my coffee and park myself in my cubicle. Before the calls start, I poke my head over the cubicle wall and introduce myself to my office neighbor.  
   
  
me:"Hi there. I'm just a contractor working with you all. What are you all doing?"  
  
  
My neighbor looks at me and cocks her head to the side, like I asked a _really_ dumb question.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Neighbor:"We've got maps of all our buried assets. When someone wants to dig, they call us and we let them know if we need to mark the property."  
  
  
She points at a map of what looks like the western halves of Missouri.  
  
Neighbor:"I'm responsible for the MOARLA corridor. Candy, next cube over is responsible for Texas and New Mexico"  
  
  
I look at the map on her cubicle and see lines crossing Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana. There are details as well. I see components of the pipelines and other details in small print.  
  
  
I hear a voice booming behind me. It comes from a large, bearded man who consciously flexes his muscles. I know he has an axe. I just hope it isn't in his office. I'll call him Tormund.  
   
  
  
  
  
  
Tormund:"I need you to be more reasonable with your policies"  
  
  
  
  
Tormund:"Unique passwords are too hard to manage. Our systems aren't connected to the Internet, so it doesn't matter. I also want the airgap testing requirement out of the policy"  
  
  
  
  
Tormund:"Yes. I'm a manager in the Industrial Controls department."  
  
  
  
  
   
  
I'm imagining what's going on in his head. It's not pretty.  
  
  
I put my hands up.  
  
  
me:"You say your systems are airgapped, but won't test to make sure"  
  
  
Tormund's nostrils flare.  
  
 
Tormund:"If you can't read the diagram we sent you, we should replace you with someone who can"  
   
  
me:"Look, I'll figure out who can sign off on this. I'll let you know"  
  
  
Tormund grunts and walks off. This is going to be fun.  
   
  
Thankfully the rest of the day is filled with less threatening meetings, comments on documents and listening into the "Call before you dig" calls.  
  
  
One caller seems to be a bit demanding. This reminds me of my help desk days. I can't hear the caller, but I can hear Candy's voice.  
  
  
Candy:"Sir, I understand that it's your land. We bought the rights to have a pipeline there"  
  
  
  
  
  
Candy:"Let me assure you, if you dig through our 12 inch pipeline, damage to your auger is the least of your worries."  
  
  
We all have a laugh at this. Candy seems to have calmed down her angry Texan.  
  
  
Everybody filters out by 5, but I'm still waiting on some edits before I leave. I take the opportunity to walk through the cube maze.  
  
  
I stop at Candy's cube and look at her map to get an idea how these pipelines work. Pipelines are layered networks. At the bottom of their OSI model, there are long tubes filled with petroleum products. On top of them are thin electrical networks to power pumps, sensors and valves and their controllers. On top of that, there's a conventional network controlling all this.  
  
  
That network runs back to control buildings.  
   
  
All this makes sense to me. There are faint notes on the map as well. I note many of the controllers have four or ten digit numbers faintly written next to them.  
  
  
I look around, then take a few pictures with my phone.  
  
  
My phone buzzes. It's a demanding email from the Director of Industrial Controls, who I assume is Tormund's boss. Since their systems are airgapped, they feel that it's absolutely ridiculous that they should have to meet unreasonable standards, let alone let those standards be written down in a policy document. More than a few people at my firm are cc'd.  
  
  
I've had enough for the day. I go back to the hotel, change and try to find decent barbecue. Sadly, all I can find is a Bandana's, which will have to suffice.  
  
  
As I see it, I'm either going to have to go to my boss and get some cover or capitulate to the ICS Wildlings.  
  
  
I plead with the waitress to bring me a plain seltzer, even trying to explain that the little switch on the side of the dispenser can be used to make this.  
  
  
She brings me a Sprite and I am sad.  
   
  
I'm mashing at my phone, getting sweet barbecue sauce on the screen when the picture of the map from Candy's cubicle comes up. Out of idleness, I swipe around the map of Texas.  
  
  
I don't know why I write down the number written on the map. I really don't know why I decide to call it.  
  
  
It answers after three rings.  
   
  
EoooooEEEEEEEoooooHHHHHHH ping ping ping ping.  
  
  
I'm a kid of the 90's. I know what a modem attempting a handshake sounds like.  
   
  
I use a few napkins and the cup of Sprite to wash my hands, I drop more than sufficient money on the table and run out of the restaurant. I pull on my helmet, jacket and gloves and make good time back to the hotel. I run to my room before taking off my helmet.  
   
  
Fifteen minutes and twenty dollars later in the hotel's business center, I have printed off Candy's map. I sit at the bar, drinking cold seltzer and calling up modems, marking the results on the printout. A few turn out to be actual humans in a port facility or control room. Some guessing later and I figure out the area codes and exchanges for most of the other numbers on the map.  
  
  
I'm practically spinning on my barstool. I see Scotch & Water walk into the bar. I walk over to her disappointment.  
  
  
me:"How would you like some high findings on your pentest report?"  
  
  
Her annoyance turns into amusement as I walk her through what I found out, including dialing one of the modems.  
    
   
She opens her laptop and starts chatting with her team to work out a test plan, then closes her laptop.  
   
  
  
  
me:"I want to write good policy, and I'm going to guess that your team will have a reportable finding that you can tell the client tomorrow. I'm hoping this might make them listen to me"  
  
  
She looks dubious, but buys me sufficient mid grade booze to let me sleep.  
   
  
The next morning, I send a meeting request to Tormund and his boss to discuss a way forward. That meeting gets accepted, then cancelled due to a "more pressing security matter".  
   
  
I re-write the policy requiring unique passwords, validation of airgaps and failed login detection. I put a comment in the document about how these are 'reasonable' controls in an increasingly dangerous world. Nobody seems to quibble about this.

When I was younger I was in a minor plane crash, nobody died but it has left me very anxious about airline travel. I haven't flown for most of my life because of it, but recently I decided to overcome this fear and finally take a trip to somewhere I've always dreamt of visiting!
I want to precursor this by saying that I am by no means skinny myself and have no animosity or ill feelings towards overweight people. I was sitting at the window seat when a very overweight man sat next to me, I began to feel very trapped as his body was actually beginning to take up some of my own seat space and I was getting pushed against the plane wall as a result. I was beginning to feel very anxious and trapped, my breathing was heavily increasing. I could sense that my heavy breathing was making him uncomfortable as he could tell he was the result of it, but I was not in the correct headspace to explain that my anxiety was not due to him, but due to the circumstances.
When the flight attendant walked by, I flagged her down and asked politely if there was another more open seat because I have a lot of airplane anxiety. I made no comment about the man's weight but he was very offended by this comment and called me a fat phobic asshole for "demanding" that I change seats. I felt horrible after he said that and wondered if I was the asshole? I did only ask to change seats because he was overweight, but it was not because I disliked or hated him for his size, only because being boxed in was giving me some anxiety. Please let me know what you think!
Edit: To those of you asking about extra seating, there weren't any more available seats on the plane so I stayed put, but the airline attendant recommended to the both of us that if either of us wanted more space in the future we could always book a more expensive ticket, to which he responded that he couldn't afford more than one seat and shouldn't be denied airline access because of his size</td><td>Hate to sound like a nut, but we can thank Biden for that.

This also means that while I work AT the electronics counter in the store of blue vests, I don't actually work for them. This of course also means that there are certain tasks I'm not supposed to do, including ringing up people that aren't purchasing any mobile accessories. There are sometimes exceptions like when the rest of the electronics associates are swamped because of understaffing. While I try to help out when they're super busy, the point is that I'm not supposed to too often.
One afternoon when I was adding some inventory to the system, one of the associates asked if I could ring up this lady, who is now Karen, who was buying iPhone screen protectors. He was the only associate working at the time, and there was a mini line of five people. He wanted to help the next customer while I ring Karen up.
One thing I forgot to mention is that I have my own little area at the electronics counter. There I have my own little seat and computer that many customers have mistaken as a cash register. It's understandable since there is also a card reader there.
Not much happened while I was checking her items out. It was just any normal transaction at the cash register. She thanks me and I tell her to have a good day. Afterward, I go back to my seat to complete the inventory.
About ten minutes later while I'm still sitting at my computer, it happens.
Karen: \*shoves her pointer finger into my face\* "YOU! You need to get off your damn chair and help everyone that's in line RIGHT NOW.
Karen: "WE ALL HAVE BEEN WAITING IN LINE AND YOU'VE JUST BEEN SITTING HERE DOING NOTHING! IT'S NOT F-"

Other associate: "Yes I understand but if you could just wait in line I will be able to assist you soon."
Karen: "Oh okay okay you see I just thought- I saw her-"
Then the Karen left without apologizing of course. Just kinda waddled off. The other associate and I just shared a look like *wtf was that?*
Karen didn't even go back in line. In fact, she wasn't in line in the first place! I had already helped her and she LEFT and for some reason felt the need to COME BACK and yell at me.

So it provides convenience in transportation for visitors. Moreover, passengers can appreciate peerless scenery in the elevator, including World Bridge of Yuanjiajie, Wulong village and Yangjiajie etc. The elevator integrates Mount Tianzi, Yuanjiajie, Jinbian Stream as a single entity, solving traffic bottlenecks problem in this scenic spot which bothers the visitors for many years.
Bailong Elevator provides visitors with convenient transportation and it plays an important role in moving the sites of hotels and other reception facilities out of the scenic area. So it helps to effectively protect the environment. 
Yuanjiajie is another world natural heritage in Wulingyuan scenic area. Previously, visitors must take more than three hours to drive on dangerous mountain road to Yuanjiajie. It would take more than five hours if you drive from the foot of mountain to Yuanjiajie scenic spot. Since Bailong Elevator was accessible to visitors, the time has shortened to be one minute and 58 seconds, which is considered to be a miracle."</td><td>0.1289919434194741</td><td>0.6958620562181907</td><td>6</td></tr>

Little back story before we get to our Karen story. Not on mobile, English is my first language. Blah blah, you know the drill.
I work in the corporate office of a fairly large scale oil and gas company as an IT admin, but I've been doing IT work for the past 20+ years. At the time, I had just moved over to this company from a smaller MSSP in the area, so I am new to the company. While I don't know every little in and out of the company workings, I can still fix simple issues like software lockups, password resets, and domain profile issues. Stuff like that.
About 3 weeks after I start, the finance company gets a few new contractors as well. One of them is our Karen.
This woman is the definition of computer illiteracy. There are 3 people that comprise the IT staff in this building and we ALL have our issues with her. The main issue being that she is needing a password reset at least 3 times a day in order to get into our financial software program.
My manager, the service desk administrator, after 2 weeks straight of this, has just about had enough and he does NOT contain his temper well. So, he starts spending less and less time in his office, (when Karen needs her password reset, instead of sending an email as per policy, she walks/waddles down to his office and sits at his door until he resets it. Like he doesn't have anything else to do.)
So, guess who starts taking the brunt of her requests? That's right! ME!!
Now, before I get to the main story, let me setup how my office is laid out. We're basically one long hallway on the top floor of a new work park building. Directly across from my office is both my HR manager and my CIO, who is the reason I was hired and how I got such a huge boost in pay, so he and I get along awesomely.
One day, Karen barges into my office with, what I suspected, was another reset of her password. And, while I was right, she didn't appreciate my assumption. At this point, Karen has become more demanding and entitled, thinking we actually work directly for HER supervisor. Not even sure why.
Karen: The entitled waddler with no memory
Me: Your hero/stuntman
AHRM: Awesome HR Manager
S: Karen's Supervisor
CIO: My BOSS boss (Chief Information Office)
Karen: "I need you to reset my password." Immediately starts to walk off.
Me: "Whoa, wait a moment, Karen. I need to know which password you are talking about."
Me: "This seems to be happening a lot for only you. Let's try and find out WHY this is happening. Could you come back and troubleshoot this with me?"
Karen: "I just need it changed! I don't have time to troubleshoot anything with you!"
Me: "I understand, but I feel like we are just putting a band-aide on the actual issue. I want to FIX the problem so you aren't wasting time coming down to our offices all the time. Wouldn't you agree?"
Me: "We can, but it won't help you get this problem fixed sooner."
Karen leaves in a huff. Now, I have to explained, she was not being quiet. And voices carry in this office building, (bad insulation, honestly.) Within 5 minutes, my Awesome HR Manager walked into my office and closed the door.
AHRM: Sits down and uncaps pen to write in a notebook, "So, tell me what just happened."
Me: "Well, Karen came in and demanded I reset her password. Everyone here knows she's been having issues with it and I wanted to rectify the main problem. Karen was obviously having none of it and threatened to get \*supervisor\* involved for no reason other than to intimidate me into just doing what she wanted."
With that, she walked out of my office and into my CIO's office.
A few more minutes later, Karen's supervisor was in my office. She's actually really chill.
Supervisor: "Karen said you aren't helping her?
Me: "Sorry S, but that's not correct. I'm was trying to fix whatever password issue she has going on, but she wasn't cooperating with my troubleshooting."
S: "I understand. Would you mind resetting it just this one last time so I can get her working? She's already WAAAAAAY behind on work."
Me: "Sure! Here's the password she'll need to use until we can find the issue"
I hand S the password I've already changed Karen's password to, written on a post-it and she's off. As S is walking out, CIO is walking in.
CIO: "Hey OP. Mind writing up an email of what just happened with Karen? SDM has been having issues with her, but had no witnesses. AHRM just came in and confirmed everything SDM has been saying about her."
I wrote up a quick email about what happened and sent it over to CIO, AHRM, S, and SDM.
The very next day, I get an email to block Karen's email, computer login, and front door access. She was escorted out of the building 5 minutes after I turned off her network access.
And, to top it all off, her password issue? As you may not be aware, when you are given a temporary password in this office, you are REQUIRED to reset your own password upon login. I looked up the logs and she would reset her password correctly. The computer would eventually time out, but when she tried logging back into the computer, instead of using the password she had JUST SET IT TO, she would try to use the TEMPORARY PASSWORD! It would lock out her profile in 3 tries.
I should have realized that this was a full on PEBKAK error, (Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Karen."
Hope you enjoyed my story! Have a great day and don't be a Karen!</td><td>You telling him about an incident is one thing, but playing the recorded proof is quite another.

My wife and I (M42) have been married for 2 years together for 15.
All this time we had either not decided to have kids or had problems getting pregnant. After some medical testing we found out that it was near impossible to get pregnant due to some medical issues with her.
We were thinking of adopting when one day she came home and told me she was expecting. Ofcourse I was super happy . 
A week later we had an appointment at the gyno and she had some blood drawn. The test came back negative and ofcourse I was devastated but she wasn't. She claimed that she was pregnant and that the doctor was wrong. We took some more store-bought ones and they all came back negative. My wife is in complete denial. Now she claims we are having twins. She is buying them clothes and decorations and is pressuring me to start with the nursery.
I am at a loss and don't know what to do. My inaction is making her believe that I want to leave them and that I am going to doom my wife into the life of a single mom.

OK...not meals like we would, and do, eat. But it's food and it sustains them and their children. And much of it is ethnic based foods that are every inexpensive locally. Rice and flour are cheap in Asian countries where those the base of their ethnic foods. Same for Africa and South America. 
The real problem involving world hunger is things money can't control. Mostly drought. When food is brought into these areas suffering from sever drought local government officials or local warlords take control of the food. They then sell it or just give it to those who support them. And having UN troops on the ground doesn't do any good. UN troops are not allowed to use force to reclaim the food or when "guarding" the distribution of the food.
America was under such restrictions when we sent troops as part of these UN relief efforts. They can't use force, even when force is needed. The first few minutes of the movie "Black Hawk Down" shows this. And the use of some force would bring control and order in most situations when the world moves to help these humanitarian disasters.

On top of that the poorer you are the more likely you are to be shot even among the poor class. (source) By blaming the institution of police on the problems of the people politicians are using race to shield their own failures. What would be a better solution to eliminating police shooting would be to not blame race but to blame the lack of upward mobility certain classes have especially in big cities where a majority of these shootings are going on. And black people keep voting for these same bad corrupt politicians in these cities over and over and expect a different result.

Episode 1
 - Thomas - Me, the manager and network admin
 - John - The older of my two other reports, primarily responsible for server maintenance, major application upgrades, and supporting our smaller off-site locations and their specific applications
 - Daniel - The younger of my two original employees, though here for the same amount of time as John.  Both longer than me, actually.  Desktop and server support, document management and phone system support, phenomenal people skills.
A little over a week has come and gone.  Jordan remains steadfast in his attempts to drive me and my other two reports to the brink of insanity.  Thus far he has failed a stunningly easy test I devised to assess his problem-solving skills, admitted to underage drinking, attempted to build camaraderie in a conversation with us all by saying "you guys know how hard it is to pull one over on my mom", and argued with me about the importance of locking computers when leaving them unattended.  
While he was away from his desk performing a task and I was talking idly with John and Daniel, I walked over to inspect the clutter Jordan had already amassed and noticed a password written on a sticky note.  
Ah, an opportunity to teach an important lesson.  I mentioned it to John and Daniel, and then waited.
"Jordan, what's wrong with your desk?" I asked upon his return.  
Daniel, who had been listening to the exchange from his desk, poked his head out from behind his monitors.
"Yeah," Jordan replied.  "It's that [anti-virus] management password you gave me.  You told me to write it down so I wouldn't forget it."
"I didn't tell you to write any password down."
I cut in, stopping the conversation and telling Jordan not to worry about it right then.  I again explained the importance of locking unattended computers, and let the issue drop until later in the day when I called him into my office.
"Close the door behind you.  About that password."
"Daniel gave me that password."
"I spoke to Daniel and he said he doesn't remember giving you that password and definitely wouldn't have told you to write it down.  You're sure?"
Intent on giving Jordan every opportunity to come clean I tried again.
"Like I said, I talked to Daniel and he's certain that he didn't give you that password.  I have to agree; it wouldn't be like him to tell you or anyone to write down a password."
"I'm positive he gave it to me and told me to write it down so I wouldn't forget."
"Jordan, I know for a fact that Daniel didn't give you that password."
"*I* gave you that password.  In an email, which also explained that you should change it when you log in the first time."
"Listen, Jordan.  I've known the whole time what was up and I've been trying to give you the chance to be honest, but you chose right from the start to throw Daniel straight under the bus.  That's not the way to build a good working relationship with your coworkers.  If you keep that up no one is ever going to trust you."
The conversation ended.  No apology, no remorse, no assurances it wouldn't happen again.  I reported this chain of events to my director, knowing that such a claim of dishonesty on the part of the HR director's son would best be handled between the two directors.  My cries would fall upon deaf ears.
The chronicles would continue.

OP, your feelings are valid -- you will be alone at Christmas, possibly for the first time since you got married, and your feelings of loss over your wife's father are no doubt strong, on top of your feelings over her plans to be away -- it sounds like FIL's love of Christmas was quite infectious. But her feelings are also valid -- that was *her daddy*. It is sad that you can't go, and you've let her know your feelings on that -- including not liking her response, and again, that's all valid. In a way, I feel like her response as you have reported it here ("suck it up and be a man", it seemed) was unnecessarily harsh on her part.
However, OP, you need to stop bring your family drama to this other female friend *NOW*. You haven't slipped yet, but if this keeps up, it *will* happen -- *most likely while your wife is away for 8 days and you're pissed off about it because you've let this friend whisper in your ear*. *You* are not the asshole -- **yet** -- but your female friend *is*.
**And under no circumstances should you spend any time with her over Christmas while your wife is away!!** Alone or otherwise.
Talk to your *wife* about the "suck it up" part, but don't be angry or accusative when you do it. Also, don't try to force anything with her, because that will drive her away, and don't worry about it becoming a yearly thing until it actually does -- as the saying goes, "don't borrow trouble."
*But for the love of all that is good and holy, OP, do not discuss this any further with your female friend!* It is none of her business, and it was inappropriate for you to bring any of this to her in the first place. Sure, it seemed natural at the time -- you've been friends for a long time, and maybe you thought you would get a "female perspective" -- but this interaction is the thin end of the wedge that has every possibility of destroying your marriage. And it would be *you* destroying it, not your wife partying in the Caribbean, as you fear.
She isn't going alone, but you also don't have to be alone -- you have family as well. Spend the time with them, then be happy for her return and hope that the trip did what her family hopes it will.</td><td>0.0971404704455238</td><td>0.7286068680016606</td><td>6</td></tr>

So I've been in the IT field for nearly a year now and I love it. But sometimes, it makes my brain hurt. Take this situation for example:
For my line of work, we provide technical support to technicians dispatched to various job sites across the country, dealing with networking equipment my employers have placed on site for the customer. I don't want to get too far into details, as I know some of my colleagues are on here fairly regularly. 
One day, my boss gave me an escalation to handle which I was pretty excited for, because it was one of the first times I'd been trusted to handle a site escalation from beginning to end. We dispatch a tech who originally says he'll show up on site Saturday morning (boo), but turns up on site Friday afternoon instead (yay!). Before we get down to business, my tech tells me he called the customer's 3rd party IT support per his ticket to let him know he is on site. This is important to remember: we HAVE to check in, otherwise everyone flips out.
So, I work with my tech and we can't figure out what the heck is going on. I can only reach half of the equipment on site, the rest of the site is offline to me. We check the other half of the site, and it turns out all the equipment is communicating locally across half the site...so it's like north Korea is communicating with itself and South Korea is doing the same, but north and south refuse to connect to each other for some reason.
We've had issues on this site in the past, and when the client's 3rd party spoke to our tech he mentioned potential ip conflicts. Crap. So we run out of time as the business is closing and decide to reschedule for another day. Since 3rd party mentioned ip conflicts, I reached out to them directly to try and coordinate a day I can have my tech go back out and I can also conference in 3rd party as well since it's their Network.
I came back to work Monday to chaos. Somehow my request for a conference call got twisted into we need to have their 3rd party on site, and in return it caused the customer to be upset as their 3rd party kept pointing fingers at us, and called me incompetent. Lovely.
Fast forward a few days later, and I'm told we're going to do a site survey, yay! /S. 
Tech gets back on site. We're doing our thing and I'm looking at old notes from the last time we worked this site, and realize one of the ports on our switch was empty when it shouldn't have been. "No..it couldn't be..could it?" I wondered aloud. The tech looks around and noticed a cat 5 cable just lying on the ground with a bunch of other cat 5 cables, but twist tied to another piece of our equipment. Plugged that sucker into our switch and the other end into the device we used to have it in, and right away I can see the entire site again.
My tech checks in with the customer who has been hovering over his shoulder every 10min, and the conversation goes something nlike this:
C: so did you fix it?
T: someone unplugged our equipment from your network which is why we only saw half the site.
C: must have been the last tech you sent out there.
T: actually it seems like it might have been your it guy. We havent been out here in months, and he mentioned to me last week on the phone there were up conflicts. Looks like his solution was to just unplug us from your network instead.
Tldr; 3rd party it calls us incompetent because he unplugged our equipment from their Network.

Edit 2: holy crap, 300 upvotes!? Thanks guys! For those who were interested, I posted another tale, this time about Hubert from help desk
Edit 3: "What were you thinking Hubert" is now up.</td><td>RAID without any mirrors or parity = either a stripe (RAID0) or a JBOD (Just a Bunch Of Disks), a.k.a. a span, which in this case was set up by a real spanner (a.k.a. the nephew). It could be a 3-disk RAID0, with the data broken up and striped across all 3 drives, but I'd guess that it was just a JBOD span. Either way, there's definitely no redundancy.
Sounds like the disk that died in the "array" was the disk that had all of the data on it (assuming a span), and there wasn't enough yet stored on the "array" to span across to the 2nd disk, let alone the 3rd. Or the array was RAID0, but again with one disk failure, the entire volume is toast.
Any way you look at it, it's a massive "oops" for Amygdala & Euripides, and for the spanner, er, nephew.</td><td>0.0971432186835887</td><td>0.7705647846791468</td><td>6</td></tr>

This will be my 3rd attempt at making this post to get my voice heard. Hopefully this sub will let me exercise my right of free speech. 
I feel people outside the black race think that we all think alike and share the same beliefs but this is so far from the truth. It's true that he who shouts the loudest gets the most attention and that is exactly what's happening in our country at the moment. There's millions of African Americans that share the same thoughts as me, but we get chewed out or canceled when our thoughts stray from the status quo. There's many videos of us speaking out against this, but it doesn't make the news as it goes against the narrative. 
A little About Me before I get into it:
1. I was born and raised in the "hood". Newark, NJ to be exact. I still live here, not by choice but by necessity. 
2. I AM NOT OPPRESSED!! Yes I still live in the city I grew up in, it's not the ghetto by any standard but it's not the suburbs neither. I have my own apartment, a nice car, and good credit. Am I where I want to be in life? No, not even close. But I'm working towards it. Where I'm at right now is 100% my fault and on me. I'm where I'm at in life because of my life choices. Had nothing to do with anyone else of any race, it was me. And have a plan to get where I want to be and there's no doubt in my mind that I will get there if I put in the work necessary. 
3. I've always been treated with respect by the police. To frame this I'm not just a black guy, I'm a very dark black guy. The black community comes in all shades from very fair skinned to very dark skinned. I fall into the darker category. I've gotten out of more tickets than I've received when being pulled over. I've never been to jail. One time I was put in handcuffs because I had a bench warrant because I didn't pay a tiny ticket I completely forgot about. 
These cops were respectful the entire time. They even took me to the atm so I could get myself out.. lol..it was less than $200. They saw I wasn't a threat and let me out of the handcuffs on the trip to the precinct. When we got their, the officer even apologized and said unfortunately I'd have to put the cuffs back on to walk into the precinct because it was policy. To add my license was suspended because of the unpaid ticket. But these officers drive me back to my vehicle and said "I can't advise you to drive this car, but once we leave you can do what you want". This proves treat people with respect you'll get the same back. And I was definitely far from home in a area that you'd consider predominantly "white" if that's a thing anyway. 
I understand that they may have good intentions but they are going about it the wrong way. They are trying to get demands made by force and violence. I feel as though this is not the way to get things done as it's just going to piss people off even more. Yeah you may get what you want, but it won't be out of support but it what be out of fear. Fear of being canceled, fear of not being re-elected, fear of losing your job if you speak up against them. America is built on democracy. What I am seeing right now is not a democracy but a dictatorship. If you don't agree with us then you are DONE. We're going to cancel you and burn down your business.
The rioting and looting was the dumbest thing to do and should have been condemned by BLM. People say oh the business have insurance they can rebuild. First off, how are people supposed to go grocery shopping etc. if you burned down the businesses in your neighborhood? Secondly, when things like this happen businesses don't usually come back. I'm from Newark,NJ. Back in the 60's we had similar riots that lasted for days because of a rumor that a black man was beaten by the police. You can look the story up as it's still a big event in history. But what I'm getting at is that my city is JUST NOW recovering from an event that happened over 50 years ago. These cities will never be the same, and I don't mean that in a good way. Jobs will not return and these businesses are gone forever to never return. 
I want to be accepted for who I am. Not because the government or BLM said you have to or suffer the consequences. The way they are going about this is causing a bigger racial divide more than ever and is counterproductive in what their trying to achieve. 
Dr. Martin Luther King said "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character". 
Black Lives Matter don't want that. They want special treatment for being born black. I want to get where I am because of my hard work. Not because I had to be hired to hit a "black" quota.
I'm rambling and don't want to make this too long. But I wanted to get my opinion out there because me and others like me feel our voices are being stifled. And we are afraid to speak up because any deviation of opinion will get us canceled which is not right and makes this country no longer the democracy It used to be.
TLDR: Black lives matter is going about things the wrong way to bring change. I'm black and never felt oppressed because of my race. Things will get worse if we remain on this path.
Edit: Here's Proof for those doubting my ethnicity. It's sad I even have to do this. It actually helps my point above. You can't be black if you think for yourself.
Edit 2: I am not a libertarian, conservative, or a Democrat. Im a registered independent. I just think with my mind, my Conscience, and heart. I posted here as it seems more accepting to think for myself than other places on Reddit that supposed to allow free speech.</td><td>That fact is that multi-billion companies whose primary job is based on risk management are certainly not going to lend THEIR money on a property that is going to be underwater within the term of their loan.

There are basically two things that affect your jump range: how much fuel you can use per one jump (determined by your fsd) and how heavy your ship is. You want to get everything as light as possible. Sometimes that means leaving stuff behind, or even downsizing core modules.
Engineering your fsd is not really that hard, since the engineers that can do it are on top of the unlock tree. Gathering the required materials is also very easy.

A little backstory, although not much is necessary, we're a typical couple (or we where)
We've been married for 5 years, both of indian descent, with dark skin to match.
we met in our workplace where we both still work together and have been (for the most part) happy ever since.
Things have been a little harder the last few years, we'd been trying for a baby for so long and started losing our hope. So when we finally got pregnant with a healthy baby boy, we where over the moon, my husband could not have been more excited to be a dad.
I'm avoiding it but, might as well cut to the chase, my baby is white. At first i didn't even really notice it, he was more red than anything, but once i saw it was like my brain split open right there in the hospital.
I can't entirly recall what happened, but my husband started screaming at me and i didnt even know what to say. of course i never cheated on him, but clear as day the baby is white! He stormed out pretty soon after, and has been at his brothers place ever since. i only know this because his brother texted me.
its been two days, he hasn't talked to me and I'm afraid to reach out, because i have nothing to even say. i understand why hes so angry, but it hurts that he would think I'd cheat, i cant help to be angry too.
I haven't been able to barley touch my baby, just looking at him makes me cry, its not his poor little fault but who's is? I'm not really a drinker, but i went to a couple events around the time i got pregnant, still i can't remember any moment i could have been drugged. did somone break into my house?
what if i never find out and my marriage is destroyed, if i can't fix this i don't know how i can take care of my son, i can't even look at him.
what do i do once i have to go back to work with him? Will i have to quit?

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>I know that hindsight is 20/20 but if you could have connected these two dots, then you could have saved up to **25% of your portfolio** before the crash.</td><td>I asked Uncle Sam for the 0% down payment since I earned the VA Home loan.</td><td>I analyzed all the controversial trades made by Senators in the 2020 Congressional insider trading scandal. Here are the results! **Preamble:** The ability of Congress Members to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. There have been multiple stories covering the 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Congress Members allegedly used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash. But none of the articles talked about the financial implications of those trades and whether the retail investors could have front-run the market using the disclosed data.  Basically, what I wanted to know was
**How much did the Senators save by offloading their positions before the crash and could I have done the same?**
For my previous analysis into congressional trading, I used data from <URL>. But not all the transactions are captured on the website and I wanted to match exactly with the trades reported by famous journals. <URL> is the United States official website where Senator, former Senator, and candidate financial disclosure reports are available. Some of the data is available as a scanned file and some in normal HTML format. I had to manually transcribe most of the data used in this analysis.
In case you are wondering about the time delay between the actual transaction and reporting, Congress Members are expected to report the transaction within 30 days. The median delay in reporting that I observed for all the trades was 28 days.
All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.
There are multiple factors at play here.
Timeline: On January 24, 2020, the Senate Committees on Health and Foreign Relations held a closed meeting with only Senators present to brief them about the COVID-19 outbreak and how it would affect the United States. I am considering this as the start time for my analysis. Any sale made by the senators after this point up to Feb 26 is considered. (I did not consider sales beyond that point as SPY dropped 8% during that week. My assumption here is it's realistic for any person be it a normal investor or a Senator to panic sell after seeing that drop). For reference, SPY dropped an additional 25% over the next 3 weeks!  
Senators under consideration: I have considered trades done by 4 senators in my analysis. I have focused on these 4 as all of them were investigated by Justice Department and the FBI following the trading scandal.
1. Richard Burr
2. Kelly Loeffler
3. James M Inhofe
4. David A Perdue
David Perdue sold 44 times ($3.49 MM) in the 33 days following the closed senate meeting. Interestingly James Inhofe only transacted 8 times but the combined value of shares he sold was a whopping $4.12MM. The most ironic part is that Richard Burr who was under investigation the longest and had to step down from the intelligence committee due to the scandal had the least dollar volume in the transaction ($1.1MM).
Before we dive into the overall amount saved by the Senators and the retail investor side of the analysis, let's see what were the best trades made by the Senators during that time period.  
 David Perdue absolutely killed it with his stock plays. He is present 7 times in the top 10 list and his best play, Caesars Entertainment reduced 83% after he sold his position. Fun Fact: if a stock reduces 83%, it has to go up 488% just to reach back to its initial price. Another interesting observation from the chart is that senators mainly sold stocks related to the entertainment and hospitality industries which were the most severely affected industries due to the pandemic. 
 
The above chart showcases the amount of money saved by the Senators due to front running the market crash. David Perdue saved an insane $2.2MM with his stock sales. I also kept a multiple of annual Senate salary to showcase the scale of impact they made to their portfolio because of the trades.
Finally, we come to the million-dollar question. **Was it possible for the retail investors to follow these trades and front-run the crash?**
This is where the analysis gets a bit tricky. 88% of the transactions were reported by March 3rd but if you consider it in dollar values, only 52% of the transactions were reported (some of the high-value transactions were reported only after the crash). But if you were an astute investor, you could have observed a stark difference in what the Senators were saying and how they were trading. For Eg. Richard Burr reassured the public that the US was well prepared for the pandemic but then sold $1MM worth of stocks in the next two weeks. I know that hindsight is 20/20 but if you could have connected these two dots, then you could have saved up to **25% of your portfolio** before the crash.
**Limitations of analysis:** There are some limitations to the analysis.
a. I have only used one black swan event for the analysis. A better method would be to analyze the stock trading pattern over 3-4 major crashes and see if any pattern emerges. But the current limitation is that <URL> has only data since 2012.
b. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress Members. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the transaction amount, I have taken the average of the given range.
I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Senators as I did not want our political views clouding our financial judgment. I could not find a single example where a retail investor or an institutional investor or even a hedge fund leveraging this information to make their trades (it might just not be public!). Another possible explanation here is that Senators might just have superior stock trading capability as none of them were indicted for this and all investigations are closed now.
However you view it, this analysis in addition to my last analysis (which proves that Congress Members have better returns than SP500) showcases that there is significant money to be made by following their trades closely!

Ring makes this intentionally hard to find and difficult to do. There are 3 steps buried deep in a menu in the app. Eventually, they generate a 9-word passphrase that's about 50 characters long. They advise storing this in a password manager, but they do not allow copying it to the clipboard (at least from the Android app). Therefore, you have to manually retype 50 characters. I screenshotted it, retyped it elsewhere, and attempted to reproduce it as required, but the app said the phrase was wrong. After checking it about 5 times, I gave up. Hanlon's Razor aside, burying the feature this much and requiring users to manually retype 50 characters instead of allowing the clipboard has to be intentional to discourage the use of this feature.
The steps I tried to follow are here. If others find an easier way to make this work, I'd love to hear it.
Edit: took another crack at this by typing on a PC and was able to get the thing enrolled in E2E encryption. But enabling this turns off basically all of the useful features of being on Ring (motion notifications, video pre-roll, shared links, event timeline, and about a dozen others).

Also -- That's a leading headline and ongoing constant tracker on 538 -- I think the whole purpose of this poll was to look at the factual belief -- apart from legal/political collusion respondents were making in the "oppose/support"poll.
And I like this poll as it highlights something  quite fascinating to me --- that 52% say he committed impeachable (removable) offenses  - yet in the same poll only 47% supported removal.
That means 5% who think "*Trump's actions regarding Ukraine or his refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry constitute enough evidence to remove him from office*" (52%) but don't support removal (47%).

Seems like a reasonable place to start. The Fed probably knows something about how to measure wealth.
> To derive this, I initially take the nominal net worth aggregates for each wealth group that are provided by the Federal Reserve and subtract out consumer durables. Consumer durables are things like cars and fridges that many academics who work on wealth distributions do not consider wealth.
Red flags starting to rise here. Why wouldn't someone's car count as wealth? And why wouldn't you just use the Federal Reserve's analysis, if you're claiming them as a source? Let's go to them directly to try to fact check something simple: has the wealth of the bottom 50% gone down since 1989, and is it now negative as this article claims? Thankfully, we're only a few clicks away from the answer. 
The fed data sourced by the article shows that the wealth of the bottom 50% was indeed $0.7T in 1989. However, while the article says that the value today is -$0.2T (for a loss of $0.9T), the actual fed source shows the current value to be $1.17T instead. In other words, **instead of decreasing 128%, the wealth of this group actually increased 67%**. Here is the graph directly from the Fed site linked in the article. We can see that the growth was negative, but that the poorest have fared much better since 2013.
> The top 1 percent owns around 32x as many consumer durables (in dollar terms) as the bottom 50 percent owns. So the subtraction of them reduces the inequality between the top 1 percent and bottom 50 percent.
The Fed data sourced shows the exact opposite of this. As of Q4 2018, the bottom 50% owned $1.37T in durable goods, compared to just $0.89T for the top 1%. More importantly, durable goods represent 20% of the assets of the bottom 50%, compared to just 3% of the assets of the top 1%. This should not be surprising: if you're lower-middle-class your car is obviously a higher percentage of your assets than if you're rich. I'm not sure if the Fed data is inflation-adjusted, but no amount of inflation adjustment can turn a positive amount of wealth negative.
The article's conclusion is cherry-picked and manipulated with a statistical sleight of hand that 99% of people won't bother to check. It seems clear to me that the author of this study was clearly trying to find a way to manipulate the reader, and therefore I can disregard this article and this site as a source in the future. I haven't even started to touch on the fact that wealth is a terrible way to measure prosperity (you'd rather be a fresh med school graduate with a -$100K net worth than an Ethiopian villager with a $0 net worth), because articles with misleading manipulations don't even deserve rational conversations.</td><td>0.1678524616932512</td><td>0.7767462694515876</td><td>7</td></tr>

But I didn't have a clue how.
That's when I heard about a national organization that promoted "investment clubs", offering support and tools to help people like me learn about investing by *doing* it. I liked the idea – get smarter, play low stakes, and maybe have a beer or two while you do it. So I told a few friends, they talked to their friends, and pretty soon, we had a budding investment club.
Since we were all friends of friends, organizing went smoothly. We elected officers and adopted a simple charter, based on the national group's templates. Minimum monthly dues were set at $10, an amount any one of us could afford to throw away. But any member could contribute more than the minimum if they liked and, to build up our investing pot, most of us did. Individual contributions bought "shares" in the club's holdings, like stock in a corporation. Higher contributions meant more shares meant more voting power when we made club decisions.
As we got rolling, a few more people heard about the club and expressed interest. So we created a little process: Attend three meetings as the guest of a member. Then, if you're still interested, club members decide whether to offer an invitation. We always did. Sign the charter, pay this month's dues, and you're in. Most new members paid extra for at least a while, to catch up to the voting power of the founding members. So everyone stood on more or less equal footing.
By year two, we had settled into a friendly routine, holding monthly meetings that were one part socializing, one part learning, and one part considering what to do with our growing little pot of cash. We picked a few stocks, starting buying a few shares at a time, and portfolio performance was added to the monthly treasurer's report. We cheered each modest gain and learned from our small losses.
Then came Pat.
Pat was an outlier in our friend group. Most of us knew her, but few knew her well. She had a reputation for being a little too loud, a little too blunt, a little too cocky, a little too rude. But she was also known to be smart. In a club focused on learning, more smart couldn't hurt, right? Besides, our well-respected President had brought her in.
And right away, Pat proved she *was* smart. She had reviewed our charter and our past minutes before she came to her first meeting. She asked solid questions about past decisions and our reasoning. She listened respectfully to the education and stock study presentations, probing politely, and made mostly appreciative comments after each meeting. Just a bit of smart-ass thrown in once in a while, but we could handle a bit.
After her third meeting, we sent her to the next room while we discussed inviting her to join us. There were a few misgivings expressed – we had all heard stories about Pat's capacity for unpleasantness, after all. But President said, "I warned her pretty bluntly that she needs to behave when she's here. We're all friends, but this is business. Money is serious. So I told her, keep yourself in check. Leave your attitude outside." Ultimately, everyone agreed, she had indeed behaved. We had no reason to doubt her sincere interest.
So we called Pat back in and President said, "Congratulations, Pat. Just pay your dues and sign here." With a flourish, Pat handed Treasurer a $10 bill, and everyone applauded as she signed the charter.
Then she said, "Thank you, all, thank you. But frankly, you really don't have any way to keep me out."
The room got quieter.
Then she turned to Treasurer and said, "Now, next month, if I'm interpreting your little reports correctly, all I have to do is give you $XXX and I'll have equal voting rights, is that right?"
"And then I'd be in charge of all club decisions," declared Pat. "That's right. Unless you all can keep ponying up more cash than I can, there's nothing you can do to stop me from running this club like my own private account with nearly double my money to play with, is there? And now that I've signed your silly charter, you don't even have any way to kick me out. So, see you all next month."
She smirked, turned and left. The door had just barely closed when the room exploded.
"How big a mistake did we just make?"
But as we looked over our template-based charter, we found she was right. There were requirements for tax reporting, officer fiscal responsibilities, bank and brokerage relationships, conflicts of interest ... and a host of other issues we'd never faced and never expected to face. There was boilerplate language about how to buy out a voluntarily withdrawing member. There was a provision allowing us to involuntarily withdraw someone who didn't keep up with dues and/or attendance.
But we had no cap on individual member contributions and no provision allowing us to kick out a stakeholder so long as they continued to pay their dues and attend meetings. And we now realized that if she could make good on her threat to buy majority holding, Pat could simply outvote any attempt to amend our charter.
A more elegant solution probably existed, but within 20 minutes, someone came up with the nuclear option. Two minutes later, we agreed to launch it. We accepted assignments, then went our separate ways to prepare for next month's meeting.
That evening, everyone arrived a bit more promptly and settled a lot more quietly than usual. Pat looked smug as she took a seat, seeming not to care that no one spoke to her. She was ostentatiously fanning herself with a personal check. Too bad we never saw it, so we'll never know if she really was ready to put her money where her loudmouth had been.
President took the floor. "Before I call the meeting to order, I have a personal announcement to make. I made a really poor recommendation to all of you last month. I feel the bad judgment I showed means I am not fit to be your president. I'm presenting my letter of resignation and my voluntary withdrawal from the club." And solemnly gave the letter to Secretary.
Pat looked like she'd been slapped, but she said nothing.
Treasurer spoke up. "Just so you all know, President spoke to me earlier about this decision, so I've already calculated withdrawal payout and have it ready, according the terms of our charter." And President took the check.
Vice President spoke next. "President, you weren't alone in that decision. I voted with you and I also regret my poor judgment. Here is my letter of resignation and withdrawal."
Treasurer said, "And here is your withdrawal payout, prepared as we discussed."
And on it went. In small clusters at first, then all in a rush, each club member declared they'd made a terrible decision, presented a letter and collected an already prepared check. Sometime during the rush, Pat stopped being silent.
But we didn't. With all the letters collected, Secretary added them to the back of a fat binder containing copies of all the club minutes, and gave the binder to Pat. "Your next club secretary will need this."
Treasurer was right behind with a similar binder of financial records, a $10 bill on top. "Here are all your club's accounting records and remaining assets."
President added the signed charter to the stack. "So, Pat, looks like you're now a club of one. You win. Good luck. And good bye." We all stood and stared silently until she shoved the stack to the floor and saw herself, sputtering, to the door.
Within 10 minutes, we had signed our newly upgraded charter, re-elected our officers, torn up all our payout checks, and put our "new" club back to business as usual. OK, maybe just a bit more giggly and a little more pleased with ourselves than usual.
Never saw Pat again. Didn't care.

I need to review [user] 's links, hopefully I'll pick something up because otherwise hybrid cloud has been a pain and it feels ham-fisted trying to use things like virtual routers in cloud. Lots of dirty NAT's to force it into working the way you would onprem. Vnet to Vnet DMVPN is one of those hackey ways to force cloud to behave like onprem while lining Cisco's wallet. There are other "multicloud" options that work similarly under the hood because it's almost the only way to do it. Native tooling works better / is better integrated to cloud but is lacking when it comes to talking to onprem and other clouds, particularly when you'd like to interconnect using private WAN to give yourself options because anyone who's worth their salt has trust issues with the internet. The rock & hard place I keep running into is cloud to cloud over middlemile(L3VPN or VPLS with managed expressroute/directconnect landings in the underlay, etc) while encrypting everything between cloud to cloud and cloud to onprem to satisfy InfoSec/TheAuditors. The solution seems to be a DMVPN over the top but then I still have problems with device level fault detection / route propagation between my WAN and the L3 "switch" in each cloud. AzureRouteServer ought to help here, but last I knew it was still in beta. I think TransitGateway in AWS can do similar but havn't finished confirming my understanding of it. At the end of the day all this gets you is a traditional DMVPN with circa \~2010 management and relies on your routing protocol to detect and handle brownouts. SDWAN / multicloud options that integrate with things like AzureRouteServer have some promise, but I haven't confirmed they'd support using expressroute/directconnect as an underlay and their documentation diagrams don't indicate it as an option..
This link helped me get a CSR working over internet & private WAN;
The smart network dumb app approach that's traditionally been onprem doesn't work well in cloud but we're frequently told to move dumb apps up to the cloud regardless. When DR is restore this replica in another region but the app can't handle being re-IP'd without also being reinstalled the DR plan turns into "rebuild x app" and management doesn't like that answer.
At the end of the day it strikes me as a mismatch of requirements and capabilities, but ultimately mangelment says "go to the cloud!" because ExecWeekly said so and feels good about themselves moving the compute expense from the capital to the operational column of the budget sheet (even though it costs more since it's on 24/7 and doesn't scale) and we're left to deal with the fallout with our arms tied behind our backs.</td><td>I have the range OBD2 chip to make my 19 sierra 5.3 full time V8 and get 16.9 according to the dash I never see it change ever</td><td>0.1678633298525015</td><td>0.7682902387918062</td><td>7</td></tr>

We sell metalworking fluids.
Metalworking fluids are lubricants that are used in the manufacturing segment when they make components for various machines. Selecting the right fluid means overall increase in productivity and a decrease in rejected components being churned out.
Now, we are one of those brands that are quite expensive compared to the local stuff. But, as the saying goes, "you get what you pay for."
But that also means that many look at the price tag and not the end benefit.
This particular story happened about 10 years ago and involved one of our then recently acquired customers.
The account was quite big for us with a lot of potential for sales. We had stiff resistance from the maintenance manager who was being aided by the purchase manager. The one guy on our side and willing to try our stuff out was the production manager. But as it was 2 against 1, it was not we were at a stalemate.
Eventually, they got themselves a shiny new fancy expensive machine, and wouldn't you know it, our product was recommended by the OEM!
And so we get our first order from that company of two barrels.
Roughly a week after delivery, I get an irate call from the maintenance manager. Now, until that Friday, I have only heard of him and have seen him once or twice when I have visited the company. I think he felt that we were beneath him or something, the man refused to even acknowledge our presence in the past.
So Friday morning, this man has somehow got my number and has called me yelling at me because that new machine has stopped working, and apparently, according to him at least, it is all the fault of my product.
I attempt to try and diagnose the cause of his trouble, only to be yelled at some more and practically ordered to show up at their place and take care of the problem.
So fair enough, I, along with one other colleague go there.
It is a long drive to a remote area. As soon as we arrive, we are greeted by quite a welcoming party.
At the head is the maintenance manager, full of righteous anger and fury.
Gathered around him are two sales people representing the local competition, the purchase manager, the general manager of the unit, and a few assorted hangers-on. I also spot our friendly production manager in the background standing very quietly.
As soon as we are within earshot, the maintenance manager starts off with his tirade.
"Ah so you are the people selling this fancy overpriced cutting oil! Come down from your AC offices to teach us, have you?"
In my best customer service voice I say "Sir, I am very sorry that this happened to you, can you please show us the machine?"
After a bit more posturing, we are marched through the whole unit, past many of the other older machines that the maintenance manager takes time to show us and point out how they all have been running with no problem whatsoever using the cheaper competitor product, while gesticulating at those two reps. He is basically gathering a nice crowd around him as he walks, revelling in the attention he has gained.
By the time we have reached the far end of the factory where the new machine is standing, it feels like the whole company is looking at us.
My colleague then takes over.
"Sir, have you checked the sump tank for contaminants?" he asks. This is a standard enough question in our field, because cutting fluids generally tend to mix in with a lot of other lubricants. It is unavoidable and in fact some of the higher quality stuff (like ours) has additives that allow the fluid to separate from those contaminants easily.
"Of course I have!" says the maintenance manager arrogantly. "But you can check it for yourself, if you want. You won't find anything unusual there! I guarantee you, whatever is in that tank is there in the tanks of all the other machines! The only difference is your oil."
So my colleague goes to the tank, everyone can see that the tank has not been closed fully. Still, no comments yet since that doesn't seem to be too out of order at the time.
As soon as the tank is opened up a bit more, a foul odour fills the immediate area. Still, not too out of the ordinary. Cutting oils and lubricants don't exactly smell nice. Although the odour was a little ... off.
Colleague peers into the depths of the tank, takes a rod that is hanging nearby and slowly fishes out the remains of a cat's corpse.
And by remains I mean remains. You don't have to be an expert in cat anatomy to know that parts of that poor kitty's body were missing and were still inside that tank.
Everyone recoiled at that sight almost at once. The maintenance manager, who up until that time was ranting about how overpriced we were and how bad our quality was stopped mid-sentence. And the stench of dead and decomposing cat have now filled the air.
We all get away from that area, and regroup outside under fresh air while that mess is being cleaned out. The maintenance manager's boss, and the general manager (GM) of the whole plant is the first to break the awkward silence. "How did a cat get inside that machine?" he asks incredulously.
So to answer that, the maintenance manager, production manager, and the two of us all troop down to the GM's office where we get to see last night's CCTV footage of the cat first jumping onto the tank's lid, and then slipping and falling inside. Kitty tried and failed escaping many times. It was really disturbing to watch. The only solace was that the camera wasn't terribly high-res and there was no sound.
So the GM calls the OEM, and puts it on speaker.
Of course, then comes the question; how was that tank left partly open like that? Well, reviewing the footage further shows the maintenance manager doing that opening and then closing it carelessly.
Boy how the tables have turned! Maintenance Manager is the one now sweating buckets while the GM looks ready to blow his top.
Unfortunately I did not get to witness the maintenance manager being reamed out because the GM had basically collected himself well enough to ask us to please come by on Monday as well. Both of us were like "Sure, whatever support you need!" and we go
I don't really know what happened to that maintenance manager, but we never really saw him in that company again. What we do know is that the company had to buy an additional two barrels from us in order to flush out that machine. They eventually switched to using our products exclusively.
Haven't got a single complaint ever since that cat-astrophe</td><td>Yeah, wife is playing some sort of game here. The fact that she got pissed at OP when MIL narced on him, even after multiple times OP tried to tell wife that she wasn't making enough food and she clearly ignored him, shows there's some sort of control game going on. By this point it seems deliberate.
OP, you are NTA. What your wife is doing is not conducive to a long healthy marriage, to say nothing of a long healthy life for you. This is a time when you need to be "wearing the pants" in the relationship. You said you don't handle confrontation well, and you feel like you've betrayed her in some way. That's the game she's playing by gaslighting you. In a way, both your wife and your MIL have betrayed you (MIL definitely when she narced on you), and it's time to confront the situation head-on, no more dancing around it.
She's hurting you by continuing to ignore your request to make more food, and when she gets angry when you try to supplement her meager offerings because your calorie requirement is much higher than she wants to admit -- or "allow".</td><td>0.1678694240811897</td><td>0.7193508933048196</td><td>7</td></tr>

I'm French and we met while he was on vacation in Europe, one thing lead to another and now I live in Ohio with him. He is a hard working gentleman, an army veteran of 2 conflicts, and thought he has a very serious and almost hostile demeanor (think resting bitch face, but angrier and on a guy) he is a big teddy bear, quick to make a joke or pull a prank and easy to laugh. He is also VERY protective of me. Since I'm not here to gush on him, I'll go on.
We were out getting groceries last week, as we were checking out I was bagging up all our stuff because the store now requires that you bag your own goods if you bring your own bags. No big deal. He pays, and I stay to help a very elderly lady behind him bag her groceries and put them in her cart (he had helped her unload them) and we offered to help her put them in her car. She shuffles away from the register and I move to follow, as I turn away I hear behind me "Where the HELL do you think you're going?"  
I turn to see a very angry looking woman glaring at me. I told her politely that I didn't work at the store and I had just helped the elderly lady to be polite and that I was now leaving with my husband to go home. I had never met an American Karen before so I thought this would be the end of it, I turn to walk away and feel a vice grip on my arm. "Don't be LAZY! Just do your job and help bag my groceries!"  
I didn't even have time to respond, she had barely finished speaking when my husband wrenched her hand off me and was yelling in her face. This was the first time in the 10 years we've been together that I saw the old soldier come out, his nose might have been 3 inches from hers and his voice was loud and frightening, "WHO THE F\*\*\* DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? HOW DARE PUT YOUR HANDS ON MY WIFE! SHE TOLD YOU SHE DOESN'T WORK HERE, ARE YOU TOO F\*\*\*ING STUPID TO UNDERSTAND SIMPLE ENGLISH? GO PAY FOR YOUR SHIT, BAG YOUR OWN DAMN GROCERIES AND DON'T YOU DARE UTTER ANOTHER F\*\*\*ING SOUND!"  
The the silence after that was intense, a store full of people could hear a pin drop. The look on her face wasn't even angry, it was pure terror. She shuffled back to here isle and waited for the cashier. My husband went to the old lady and said, "I am so sorry you had to hear all that, ma'am. I apologize if my language was offensive. I hope you will still allow us to help you load your groceries into your car."  
It was surreal, like he had just flipped on a switch and flipped it back off.  
Also, we got chased down by the store manager who suggested we could be banned because of the yelling and bad language. Husband just shrugged and said they had better ban the Karen too for assaulting me, and that there are other grocery stores in town, we just go to this one because it's close.

Random BSOD's of different types I'd never seen before and certainly never together.
First step: remote OS rebuild. Was fine for a day or two and then the issue returned. The dev was rather snippy because they had to reinstall all their tools & sw again for nothing - which to be fair I sympathise with but it was the obvious first option to try. 
Second step: I dispatched our hardware guy to check things out and swap in a new computer if necessary - and to make his life easier asked the dev to make sure the desk around the PC was clear. Which he duly did, even swapping in a new motherboard just in case ... and then less than a week later the problem returned.
Third step: Our hardware guy and I had a chat, scratched our heads and declared that the devs computer was obviously cursed. He headed up with a replacement computer and I called the now seething dev to let them know it was inbound and to clear their desk. 
Guess what? Four days later it started randomly blue-screening again.  
The dev was absolutely livid at this point, threatening to escalate over all the missed productive time etc. I happened to be in their building that day for a meeting and decided to swing by to show willing and perhaps pour some oil on troubled waters. The dev wasn't there but I thought I'd leave a note and looked on their desk for a post-it and pen.
And that was when I spotted the dev's collection of a dozen or so fridge magnets from various holiday destinations stuck to the side of the metal computer case - mostly over where I estimated the HD was located.
Muttering under my breath I removed them. I realised that the dev had probably helpfully removed them each time I'd told them the hardware guy was coming ... and then reattached them afterwards - probably right before the workstation started falling over again. 
I'd cooled off a bit by the time I got back to my own building and wrote an *excruciatingly* polite email identifying them as the likely root cause and asking sweetly when they'd like another remote rebuild - assuming the new device hadn't been completely trashed by the magnets already. 
I've met more than a few devs who grok the hardware/ops side of things really well (some almost scarily so) and most have the right troubleshooting mindset too ... but sadly others just aren't interested or even remotely curious about that side of things.</td><td>Trust me: the internet knows your IP address. The internet *must* know your IP address, in order for it to be able to send you the data that you request when you pull up a web page or fetch your email. If the internet *didn't* know your IP address, you won't get any cat videos.
Furthermore, "your" IP address *doesn't belong to you*, plus it changes periodically. It belongs to the ISP that you get your internet service from; they just lease it out to you.
So, what you want to do is use a dynamic DNS service, or DDNS, something like No-IP or Dyn. You'll set up an account with one of those services, pick a domain name, then run a small program on your server which will update that domain name with the IP address currently assigned to your router (it's likely that your router has the capability built into it, so you wouldn't need to install anything anywhere else). Also, forward the ports in your router necessary for them to connect to your Minecraft server.
Now, you just tell your Minecraft friends to connect to your server at myminecraftserver.dynamicdnsservice.tld (don't use that, because it's fake; replace it with your actual dynamic domain name). They can technically still get your IP address, but *that doesn't matter*. And at this point, all they could do with the IP address is exactly what they can do with your DDNS domain name: connect to your Minecraft server, and maybe run a port scan, which at this point would only show the Minecraft server.
BTW, having an IP address *does not* give anyone your exact location. The *best* it can do is show that you use a specific ISP and are located somewhere within a couple hundred square miles of the address on record for that ISP's local office. And for some ISPs, they don't associate IP addresses with specific office locations, so your IP address might locate you to a spot thousands of miles away from your actual geographical location, i.e. the headquarters office of the ISP.</td><td>0.1289959331780434</td><td>0.7252887719596013</td><td>7</td></tr>

This is the original text from the book where Desiderata was first published.
Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.
Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.
Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.
Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful.

But I've run into a strange problem that I've spend several hours on and I really can't figure this one out.
I use VMWare ESXi on a Dell R820 Server for this lab. The server is connected to a regular residential ISP modem (via some cisco layer 3 witches).   I have made a quick schema (<URL>) to make my setup more clear. But it is basically Ubuntu Desktop VM -> PFSense VM -> PaloAlto VM -> ISP Modem -> internet.
The issue that I have is that the Ubuntu VM (Ubuntu01 in the schema) cannot access the internet in any way. No ping, no dns, no nothing. But the strange part is that the Ubuntu VM can ping the ISP modem (192.168.0.1), so the traffic is routed as it should through the  PFSense and PaloAlto. During my troubleshooting I tried to attach the (same) Ubuntu VM to the portgroup that connects the PFSense to the PaloAlto and from there it can access the internet just fine (Ubuntu02 in the schema).
It is just a lab, I know I don't need the PFSense and everything would work just fine if I let the Palo handle everything. But I would like to understand what is happening.

All I meant by the second piece is that if you're terminating your WLC on data center switches and not flex connecting, then you need to have a L2 path to the IP networks that clients are getting.  It could be that you're terminating the WLC on the same switches that host the IP networks you wish your wifi users to land on, so if that's the case then you already have your L2 path and you're good.</td><td>0.1290078163510699</td><td>0.8019463862701528</td><td>7</td></tr>

It's also confirmed that things change if you beat NG+ more than once.
However, Paul Tassi from Forbes has written that it's NOT worth rushing the main quest just to get to NG+, since the unique rewards you get aren't super interesting and you will miss out on cool side quests.

Firstly, we all agree, proliferation of nuclear weapons is a concern, as the accidental misuse or intentional malicious use of even one of these, has a larger fallout than conventional weapons. I do not think any society would allow civilian individual control of such devices. So, the question is no longer one of principal, but rather one of degree. At which point does a weapon become powerful enough, that we are justified in enforcing laws based on non-proliferation.
Secondly, I would argue, at this point in time, the military might of the government is of a order of magnitude larger than anything civilians can muster. At the point where the state has the power to destroy you remotely through drone attacks, whether you carry an automatic rifle or a pistol is largely irrelevant. So, using the second amendment, as a means to fight against state tyranny is a largely superfluous argument.
Thirdly, the entire purpose of a state is to be a monopoly on force, enforcing laws, so that I am in no danger of physical harm from my fellow men. The way we prevent the formation of a tyrannical state, is more through separation of power, and term limits.

Another story form my time at Sunup working under a Karen.
To summarise I used to work in a disability shared accommodation agency. It's a job where you support 4-6 people with disabilities who share the accommodation. Its shift work, 2 clients per staff member during the day, 1 staff member on a "sleep over" at night. The rosters are 4 week rotating rosters. I was employed as a 0.75 meaning I work 75% of what is considered full time (equating to 57 hours a fortnight). Additional information that is important, on weekdays between 9am-3pm the residents attend various day centre/employment programs with other agencies so staff are not rostered during the day. House supervisors are rostered during the day for there administration work.
I was working in a house I'll call sunup. Sunup had 4 residents and 7 workers. Each house had a house supervisor, they reported to the cluster manager (who managed 6 houses), cluster managers reports to the CEO. My house supervisor was a Karen and I will call her by her title. 
One day while I was working at sunup, one resident was "Tom". Tom was wheel chair bound, non verbal that had a neurologist appointment in a few months. I received a call from the clinic advising me of a cancellation appointment the following day at 9:30 am that is now available. I accepted the appointment, called the cluster manager (it was a rostered day off for Karen) who asked me to work the following morning from 9am-12:30pm and take tom to this appointment, I accepted and the cluster manager said she will email Karen and let her know.
The following day I got to Sunup at 8:55 am, clocked on and said hello to Tom as the previous workers left. I started to prepare Tom for the outing. I heard Karen enter the house at 9:05am I walked down to meet her and was met with a "What the hell are you doing here, you're not working today. Go home" I tried to explain and she said "Did I stutter? I said GO HOME; I did not ask you to work so I'm not paying you to work". 
Cue the Malicious compliance.
I walked over the docking station, clocked out and said.
 
"Ok Karen, as you requested, I'm off. Oh. Tom has an appointment at 9:30am, he is watching TV and he is ready to go. Taxi will be here soon, Cluster Manager emailed you with the details. I'll see you tomorrow for my next shift". As I left she said "wait what?" I closed the front door and walked to my car and drove off. Karen called my mobile and said "Why didn't you tell me about the appointment, can you come back and take him? Ill authorise the pay." 
Me "No. Cluster manager asked me to come in today at 9am, I started today at 9am. You dismissed me at 9:05, as per our award as I was requested to work, and I showed up at work, I'm getting paid the minimum 3.5 hours"
Karen "well as you're getting paid you need to come back in and work it"
Me "well Karen, you did dismiss me and I clocked out. If I came back I'm no longer covered under the Organizations insurance as I'm not clocked on.  I'm entitled to 3.5 hrs of work and I will be paid the 3.5 hours"
Karen "Just clock back on"
Me "well I can't, the award also states I'm entitled to a 3hr break between shifts. I don't know if you're aware but I did just clock out and after that shift I'm tired. Even if I did that means you need to pay me an additional 3.5 hrs. I don't think payroll would be happy paying me 7hrs for a 1hr medical appointment."
Karen "We will discuss this tomorrow!" Karen hung up on me.
I called the cluster manager and informed her of the situation, even though she is a close friend of Karen she acknowledge I was in the right and ensured I'd be getting paid. Karen did not bring it up again.
TLDR Rude Karen payed me 3.5 hrs of pay for 10 minutes of work.
Edit: Karen did take Tom to his appointment.</td><td>And also, you have to be at least 25 most of the time to be allowed to be added.
I worked for an orange stripey rental car company in the mid-90s. I wasn't yet 20, so even as an employee I could not rent, but I could drive the cars when we had meetings at HQ 2 hours away (and around town to fuel up or wash). Anyway, we had a special deal with the national lab in our little town, a special rate, and also if you were on lab business you could be 21 to rent. But if it was personal, even as a lab employee, you had to be 25, but you still got a discounted rate.
Lady rents a Toy Turd, er, Toyota Tercel from us for the weekend. She added no additional drivers to the contract, got the lab employee personal rate, don't remember what if any coverage from us. She had her teenage daughter with her, and we made it clear she couldn't drive it.
A couple days later, we had to bring up a couple of drivers from our location about an hour away, to help deal with an accident with one of our cars. Turns out it was this lady's car. She decided to let her daughter's boyfriend drive the thing, probably with the daughter along for the ride. He drove along a mountainous back road (well-maintained state highway, but through some back-roads type areas just outside of town), came upon an elk in the road, swerved to avoid it, caught the tire in the little gutter at the edge of the road, and flipped the car.
I had to go take a look at it at the tow yard, to help prepare it for moving to our main service center at HQ, and it was just rekt. Glass everywhere, battery burst, roof all rolled up, the whole bit. Car was worth about $10k new, the boyfriend did roughly $13k damage to it.

This will be my 3rd attempt at making this post to get my voice heard. Hopefully this sub will let me exercise my right of free speech. 
I feel people outside the black race think that we all think alike and share the same beliefs but this is so far from the truth. It's true that he who shouts the loudest gets the most attention and that is exactly what's happening in our country at the moment. There's millions of African Americans that share the same thoughts as me, but we get chewed out or canceled when our thoughts stray from the status quo. There's many videos of us speaking out against this, but it doesn't make the news as it goes against the narrative. 
A little About Me before I get into it:
1. I was born and raised in the "hood". Newark, NJ to be exact. I still live here, not by choice but by necessity. 
2. I AM NOT OPPRESSED!! Yes I still live in the city I grew up in, it's not the ghetto by any standard but it's not the suburbs neither. I have my own apartment, a nice car, and good credit. Am I where I want to be in life? No, not even close. But I'm working towards it. Where I'm at right now is 100% my fault and on me. I'm where I'm at in life because of my life choices. Had nothing to do with anyone else of any race, it was me. And have a plan to get where I want to be and there's no doubt in my mind that I will get there if I put in the work necessary. 
3. I've always been treated with respect by the police. To frame this I'm not just a black guy, I'm a very dark black guy. The black community comes in all shades from very fair skinned to very dark skinned. I fall into the darker category. I've gotten out of more tickets than I've received when being pulled over. I've never been to jail. One time I was put in handcuffs because I had a bench warrant because I didn't pay a tiny ticket I completely forgot about. 
These cops were respectful the entire time. They even took me to the atm so I could get myself out.. lol..it was less than $200. They saw I wasn't a threat and let me out of the handcuffs on the trip to the precinct. When we got their, the officer even apologized and said unfortunately I'd have to put the cuffs back on to walk into the precinct because it was policy. To add my license was suspended because of the unpaid ticket. But these officers drive me back to my vehicle and said "I can't advise you to drive this car, but once we leave you can do what you want". This proves treat people with respect you'll get the same back. And I was definitely far from home in a area that you'd consider predominantly "white" if that's a thing anyway. 
I understand that they may have good intentions but they are going about it the wrong way. They are trying to get demands made by force and violence. I feel as though this is not the way to get things done as it's just going to piss people off even more. Yeah you may get what you want, but it won't be out of support but it what be out of fear. Fear of being canceled, fear of not being re-elected, fear of losing your job if you speak up against them. America is built on democracy. What I am seeing right now is not a democracy but a dictatorship. If you don't agree with us then you are DONE. We're going to cancel you and burn down your business.
The rioting and looting was the dumbest thing to do and should have been condemned by BLM. People say oh the business have insurance they can rebuild. First off, how are people supposed to go grocery shopping etc. if you burned down the businesses in your neighborhood? Secondly, when things like this happen businesses don't usually come back. I'm from Newark,NJ. Back in the 60's we had similar riots that lasted for days because of a rumor that a black man was beaten by the police. You can look the story up as it's still a big event in history. But what I'm getting at is that my city is JUST NOW recovering from an event that happened over 50 years ago. These cities will never be the same, and I don't mean that in a good way. Jobs will not return and these businesses are gone forever to never return. 
I want to be accepted for who I am. Not because the government or BLM said you have to or suffer the consequences. The way they are going about this is causing a bigger racial divide more than ever and is counterproductive in what their trying to achieve. 
Dr. Martin Luther King said "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character". 
Black Lives Matter don't want that. They want special treatment for being born black. I want to get where I am because of my hard work. Not because I had to be hired to hit a "black" quota.
I'm rambling and don't want to make this too long. But I wanted to get my opinion out there because me and others like me feel our voices are being stifled. And we are afraid to speak up because any deviation of opinion will get us canceled which is not right and makes this country no longer the democracy It used to be.
TLDR: Black lives matter is going about things the wrong way to bring change. I'm black and never felt oppressed because of my race. Things will get worse if we remain on this path.
Edit: Here's Proof for those doubting my ethnicity. It's sad I even have to do this. It actually helps my point above. You can't be black if you think for yourself.
Edit 2: I am not a libertarian, conservative, or a Democrat. Im a registered independent. I just think with my mind, my Conscience, and heart. I posted here as it seems more accepting to think for myself than other places on Reddit that supposed to allow free speech.</td><td>> screaming about AI destroying artists' livelihoods.
I hate to bust your narrative, but the threat is real. Myself, I am a small businessman who over the years has spent thousands on graphic artists. I can now use Midjourney and create work every bit as good as what I was buying for what would have been thousands of dollars for tens of dollars. 
With what I have learned to do on Midjourney, I seriously doubt I will hire another graphic designer in the near future, if ever again. If I were a graphic designer I would move fast to learn how to leverage AI because those who don't are going to vanish rapidly.

The real question isn't whether it is good for the consumer or whether "jobs" are lost, but rather the effect on the net real income of the community. 
On one side we have Walmart's lower prices which would tend to increase real income, all else being equal.
On the other side, profit earned by locally-owned businesses is likely to stay in the community. Walmart's profits primarily go elsewhere. Also if the aggregate pay of local Walmart employees is lower than what was displaced (salaries and number of jobs) then this reduces real income. 
So on a community wide basis, the question is whether the first factor is enough to offset the other two. 
And it can get more complicated. A large store can make shopping more convenient (one stop!)... but on the other hand people are notorious for discounting the real cost of driving. Plus there are non-economic factors... most people prefer the character of a town that has a lot of local businesses rather than one monolithic retailer.</td><td>I have been saying here for some time that PR needs to legalize recreational cannabis and tax it.

"This phraseology "climate change denier", is not only inaccurate, it is insulting. Nobody seriously denies that the climate is warming and nobody calls themselves a "climate change denier". That is a label given to people who are skeptical of the claims of doom and gloom made by the eco-warriors.
What is a matter of debate is whether the change is man-made and whether it is something to be alarmed about. Despite what some would have you believe, science is never settled and there are legitimate scientific reasons to question the consensus that the climate's change is anthropogenic in nature and that a crisis is imminent if not already happening.
There was a time when Eugenics was the consensus best way to improve humanity. Science is not done by consensus and skepticism is a fundamental part of science.
Using the word denier is not only inaccurate for the reason mentioned before, it is insulting because it tries to attribute the same negative feelings associated with holocaust deniers.

Long time lurker, first time poster.
I've worked in a data center for a large social media company as a systems administrator on the repairs team and absolutely loved it, who wouldn't?!
One day, the repairs lead was working from home and needed some help with a system that was misbehaving. He was able to get into the box through the out-of-band network (management side of the system) but it wasn't responding over the production network (machine was out of production, usually mean broke machine or broke switch). So he pinged me and asked me to cold boot it so I just brought my phone instead of my laptop so I could message him and walk at the same time (this is kinda important later).
Upon arriving to the cold aisle side of the machine (the front of the machines face each other so the cold air from the floors would cool it down, this means the hot side is facing each other, hence the hot and cold aisles being different - for those who have never worked in a DC before), I saw the ID lights on (this meant that out-of-band was working - good news so far). Went to the hot aisle and cold booted the machine, it had redundant PSUs stacked on top of each other so two cables were unplugged. When I plugged the machine back in I looked at my phone to ping the lead and I immediately got a continuous stream of smoke in my face. I looked up an the server was on fire (literally.. flames, smoke, the whole thing). I unplugged the machine and quickly replaced it (it was a high priority machine). Left the machine at the parts depot and took a look cause I was curious what happened. Apparently the bottom PSU short circuited somehow, caught fire, then caught the second one on fire. yay......
Later strolled into the office like nothing happened. A co-worker asked how were things and I told them about the fire. My manager turned around with incredible speed with wide-eyes and asked "what?!" me, pointing towards the server room doors: "A server caught fire." Her: "Show me." We walked up there and I showed her the damage. She took pictures and sent them (and the server) off to the hardware engineering team. I was in the chat room for that team cause I was doing a lot of work for them and other teams and shortly after she sent if to them, it appeared in the chat... We nicknamed it the Fire Control Board instead of the Power Control Board. :)
Round 1 tl;dr - Lead repairs tech sent me on boobie trapped mission to fix machine. Fire happened, I freaked out, manager freaked out. Did not end well. No fire department arrived (why no fire dept.?!?!) -\_-
This was during after hours and I was hanging out/working with the networking and integration leads on in-taking new machines (cause I was repairs, and they needed someone there to fix things as they popped up). Had the following chat with them.  Integrations guy ($IG), Networking Guy ($NG) and $Ghost.
$IG and $NG come running over from either side of the aisle.
$Ghost: IDK but it was one of these (points to lower 20 machines).
I leave the building and I hear the sound of a a fire alarm going off, sounded like it was in the distance so I shrug it off and go for burgers.
I leave the DC gate and head down the street (the street dead ends to the end of our building and the gate is at the dead end side). As I was heading to the main street, I saw fire trucks slowing down and turning (me thinks "oh crap..."). I get to the end of the street and the trucks get to the dead end (me thinks "don't go through the gate, don't go through the gate), they go through the gate. Me being hungry: meh... I'll handle it after I get food... I come back and the fire department is closing the the hydrant (me thinks, while shocked: "OH LORDIES AM I IN FOR IT).
I get back in to the office holding the burgers and my manager grabs my by the shoulders and went "$Ghost $Ghost, WHERE WERE YOU?!?! I was worried sick because of the alarms" (btw.. I was the youngest admin at the time so Manager was like an at-work mom..). I held up the burgers further and said: I got burgers (and smiled innocently of course!)... She proceed to do the biggest face-palm I've ever seen to this day.
Round 2 - tl;dr - Fire happened... again... Fire department was called, manager freaked out (again), I got burgers, manager face palmed harder than ever cause I got burgers while the firemen did their thing. It was as good time... for me...

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>I thought I'd try and do a write up of this call in particular, mainly because what I've seen thus far seems inadequate.</td><td>By policy, I mean written and unwritten laws, rules, procedures, processes, regulations, and guidelines that govern people.</td><td>My thoughts on the Clemson Incompletion: What's a Catch? In the past 12 or so hours since the end of the OSU v. Clemson game I've seen a lot of hot takes, misunderstandings, and straight up misinformation about what is or isn't a catch. I thought I'd try and do a write up of this call in particular, mainly because what I've seen thus far seems inadequate.
If you want the **TLDR: I think they got the call correct by overturning it.**
Without further ado, let's break this down.
The NCAA provides for us the rules free of charge. I'll go ahead and copy out the relevant sections here:
> Catch, Interception, Recovery
>> a. To catch a ball means that a player:
>>> 1. Secures firm control with the hand(s) or arm(s) of a live ball in flight before the ball touches the ground, and
>>> 3. Maintains control of the ball long enough to enable him to perform an act common to the game, i.e., long enough to pitch or hand the ball, advance it, avoid or ward off an opponent, etc., 
>> h. When in question, the catch, recovery or interception is not completed. 
We will circle back to these later
>Procedures
>> c. All reviews shall be based upon video evidence provided by and coming directly from the televised production of the game or from other video means available to the replay official that is also available to the television producer. 
I do not have a copy of the CCA Mechanics Manual, but at this level of football, officials are instructed to beanbag fumbles and review them in the booth. If one of the NCAA officials on here could copy out the phrasing, please do.
So now that we've established these lets jump right in
These are enumerated above, but to expand on them:
* Tucking the ball
* Extending the ball for the goal line
* Moving the ball away from a defender
* Advancing under your own power
* Taking steps BY ITSELF is not an act common to the game. Maintaining feet from the point of contact is not indicative in and of itself a move common to the game. Imagine in this hypothetical scenario that that the Clemson WR had remained with his hands on the ball and went to the ground. He would have been marked down by forward progress where he initially contacted the ball, as he did not actively make these steps. So lets dispense with that one right now.
* Trying to do any of the above and failing in the process is not indicative of a move common to the game.
* The speed of the ball carrying it to your helmet is not a move common to the game. 
**Looking at replays and thinking through the process**
Unfortunately these are the only clips I have from the game, as most of the articles through page 3 of google simply use the sportscenter slowmo. If anyone has other clips please send them too me so I can edit it in.
So full speed, the HLJ is perfectly in position to make this call. He's about 3 yards from the play, judging by where his hat is pointed he's staring right at this catch. As soon as he sees the ball come out, he drops his beanbag and runs to the GL for the reverse mechanic, and the R signals the TD. As a scoring play, it immediately goes to review.
Looking back at the mechanics manual, the HLJ drops the bean bag to cover himself. If he blows the whistle and it was in-fact a fumble for a TD, he's probably never going to work a CFP game again for having an inadvertent whistle on a scoring play.
Now that we are in the review, we need to have firm control, and an act common to the game.
Full Speed Front View - From here we can see that the steps taken are from the force of contact by the DB from the moment of catching, the steps alone do not count as our move common. This leaves an attempt to ward or tuck.
Slow Motion Back Cam - From 0:03 to 0:05 we can see the WR left hand come off of the ball while attempting to tuck it to his waist, at which point the ball is dislodged by the DB.
Given this, I don't think this is a catch, but it's still a very close call.
Circling back to subsection h, *"When in question, the catch, recovery or interception is not completed."* Given that the HLJ let the play go as he wasn't sure it was a catch or not, and that it seems unclear after looking at this all day whether he completes his act common, this is ruled incomplete.
For games such as this, the call is reviewed at the SEC HQ, the replay booth, and on the field. Given that all crews independently came to the same conclusion, I feel quite confident that this was the right call.
*Can the replay booth/HQ overrule the field crew?*
No, the ruling of the white hat on the field is final. That said, he is subject to a post game review process by the conference.
*But what about hypothetical scenario involving goal line/out of bounds?*
You have to maintain control while doing your move. Simply catching the ball is not enough, it has to be maintained through contact \(see this play\)
I'll add more as I see them come in
*Do you have more clips like this?*
Here's a video where Redding breaks down a very similar play in TAMU v. UA. Notice how the WR successfully tucks and turns under his own power before it's immediately stripped.
Here's a video in which it was called an incompletion, TAMU vs. LSU. WR never completes his act common to the game before losing control.
This is an incompletion. Steps do not matter if you don't have control.</td><td>The word "racism" has been completely redefined by the left in the last 5 years. Racism used to have a simple definition: the belief that one race is superior to another, leading to discrimination. Now, it also means something else. The dictionaries have literally been changed. By this definition, **any disparity in outcomes is racist**, even if no explicit bias or discrimination is involved. Conversely, any policy or action that makes outcomes more equal is "anti-racist", even if it is explicitly discriminatory against whites. Further, they state that any person or policy that is not explicitly anti-racist is racist. This is how you end up with people stating things like "only white people can be racist because racism requires power".
One of the most visible proponents of this view is a Boston professor and author named Ibram X Kendi. Here are some excerpts from his bestselling book (source 1, source 2). Apologies for the long quotes, but I want to give appropriate context:
> The opposite of "racist" isn't "not-racist." It is "anti-racist." ... There is no in between safe space of "not racist." The claim of "not racist" neutrality is a mask for racism... The common idea of claiming "color blindness" is akin to the notion of being "not racist"—as with the "not racist," the color-blind individual, by ostensibly failing to see race, fails to see racism and falls into racist passivity. **The language of color blindness—like the language of "not racist"—is a mask to hide racism**...
> A racist policy is any measure that produces or sustains racial inequity between racial groups. An antiracist policy is any measure that produces or sustains racial equity between racial groups. By policy, I mean written and unwritten laws, rules, procedures, processes, regulations, and guidelines that govern people. **There is no such thing as a nonracist or race-neutral policy.** Every policy in every institution in every community in every nation is producing or sustaining either racial inequity or equity between racial groups...
> The defining question is whether the discrimination is creating equity or inequity. If discrimination is creating equity, then it is antiracist. If discrimination is creating inequity, then it is racist. ... **The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination**. The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.
This guy is not some loon. He is widely listened to and these definitions are the basis of how race is taught in corporate diversity trainings and college campuses. The common parlance is now that any inequity of outcomes is oppression and systemic racism. A definition that literally wasn't in the dictionary 5 years ago is now the truth, and questioning it or wanting to be "race-neutral" in your approach to the issue is racist. This is how you end up with policies like states giving preferential vaccine access based on race. MLK's values of "judging people by the content of their character, not the color of their skin" might be considered racist by some today. That's just insane to me.</td><td>0.2266482323569305</td><td>0.7228003376656094</td><td>8</td></tr>

>When I come to think of it, in my own imagination, beards were not found among Hobbits (as stated in text); nor among the Eldar (not stated). All *male Dwarves* had them. The wizards had them, though Radagast (not stated) had only short, curling, light brown hair on his chin. Men normally had them when full-grown, hence Eomer, Theoden and all other named. But not Denethor, Boromir, Faramir, Aragorn, Isildur, or other Numenorean chieftains.
Note that the italics are a part of the printed book. Whether this accurately reflects Tolkien himself putting additional emphasis on the words in his writings or not is probably up for debate.
It is however interesting that he does make the distinction in this case. In the cases of Men and Elves, his statements can be already assumed to apply solely to the males of their respective races. So from this, my assumption would be that female Dwarves do have beards, but that they are not necessarily ubiquitous.
We are, however, forced to accept that Pharazon's appearance does not conform to Tolkien's word on this, along with Isildur and Elendil (in both RoP and the Jackson movies), and Aragorn, Boromir, and Faramir (in just the Jackson movies).
So if you see anyone complain about Disa's lack of beardage, just check to make sure they're a true beard-purist, and that they also find issue with the other instances of potential beard-inaccuracy. If they don't care about those beards (for whatever reason, like, say, improved visual storytelling by being able to differentiate Men and Elves more clearly. Unless that is, they accept a similar excuse for giving Disa a wispy beard instead of the full monty), then it's quite possible that the reason for their complaints isn't *really* the beard-accuracy of what's on display.</td><td>Sadly I did not find a way other than just repetition and about 6hours of trying.

I think that is sad, since your question is a good one. It's also the first question everyone asks about prison abolition.

Now I'm not an expert, and I don't necessarily agree with the idea. There is also a ton of diverse thoughts in this area.  So take this with a big grain of salt. I will quote Wikipedia a bunch, which isn't great, but it's what I've got. 
To start, prison-abolitionists would not want Chauvin and the rioters in prison either. It's not a "they secret want to get us" kind of thing. They truly believe our society would be better off without prisons.
Now I'm going to quote Wikipedia for some basic info. From the "prison abolition movement" article:
>Many anarchist organizations believe that the best form of justice arises naturally out of social contracts, restorative justice, or transformative justice.
From Wikipedia article about restorative justice:  
>A restorative justice program aims to get offenders to take responsibility for their actions, to understand the harm they have caused, to give them an opportunity to redeem themselves and to discourage them from causing further harm. For victims, its goal is to give them an active role in the process and to reduce feelings of anxiety and powerlessness.
Transformative justice:
>Transformative justice takes the principles and practices of restorative justice beyond the criminal justice system. It applies to areas such as environmental law, corporate law, labor-management relations, consumer bankruptcy and debt, and family law. Transformative justice uses a systems approach, seeking to see problems, as not only the beginning of the crime but also the causes of crime, and tries to treat an offense as a transformative relational and educational opportunity for victims, offenders and all other members of the affected community.
So that is a fast-and-very-loose outline of what prisons could be replaced with. Instead of throwing someone in a box for years, teach them how they harmed the victim, and try to get them to change behavior. If the problem is the system itself, see if a change in the system might help. From my own experience, these folks are often heavily involved in stopping crime before it starts - things like better welfare programs, drug treatment programs, mental health programs, education, that kind of thing.

Nobody needs to steal $250 worth of food to feed themselves or their families. 
Theft is rampant in major cities. People walk in, take what they want, and walk out. In Seattle, they put cops at a local Target for a few hours and arrested 35 shoplifters in just a few hours. Despite the fact that these thefts were "organized", taking specific items that are easy to resell, nearly all were charged with misdemeanors and immediately let go because it's hard to steal $750 worth of merchandise at once. It's gotten to the point where downtown stores are locking up more and more. Even ice cream is now behind lock and key. Meanwhile, the city has for years had a roving open air drug market where you can buy all your drugs and stolen goods all in one place, which aside from the occasional raid when they need a PR win, the city just allows.
What's needed is more enforcement, especially against repeat offenders who have been arrested, convicted, and let go dozens of times.</td><td>0.2266530594828981</td><td>0.6882870898639434</td><td>8</td></tr>

So I've been in the IT field for nearly a year now and I love it. But sometimes, it makes my brain hurt. Take this situation for example:
For my line of work, we provide technical support to technicians dispatched to various job sites across the country, dealing with networking equipment my employers have placed on site for the customer. I don't want to get too far into details, as I know some of my colleagues are on here fairly regularly. 
One day, my boss gave me an escalation to handle which I was pretty excited for, because it was one of the first times I'd been trusted to handle a site escalation from beginning to end. We dispatch a tech who originally says he'll show up on site Saturday morning (boo), but turns up on site Friday afternoon instead (yay!). Before we get down to business, my tech tells me he called the customer's 3rd party IT support per his ticket to let him know he is on site. This is important to remember: we HAVE to check in, otherwise everyone flips out.
So, I work with my tech and we can't figure out what the heck is going on. I can only reach half of the equipment on site, the rest of the site is offline to me. We check the other half of the site, and it turns out all the equipment is communicating locally across half the site...so it's like north Korea is communicating with itself and South Korea is doing the same, but north and south refuse to connect to each other for some reason.
We've had issues on this site in the past, and when the client's 3rd party spoke to our tech he mentioned potential ip conflicts. Crap. So we run out of time as the business is closing and decide to reschedule for another day. Since 3rd party mentioned ip conflicts, I reached out to them directly to try and coordinate a day I can have my tech go back out and I can also conference in 3rd party as well since it's their Network.
I came back to work Monday to chaos. Somehow my request for a conference call got twisted into we need to have their 3rd party on site, and in return it caused the customer to be upset as their 3rd party kept pointing fingers at us, and called me incompetent. Lovely.
Fast forward a few days later, and I'm told we're going to do a site survey, yay! /S. 
Tech gets back on site. We're doing our thing and I'm looking at old notes from the last time we worked this site, and realize one of the ports on our switch was empty when it shouldn't have been. "No..it couldn't be..could it?" I wondered aloud. The tech looks around and noticed a cat 5 cable just lying on the ground with a bunch of other cat 5 cables, but twist tied to another piece of our equipment. Plugged that sucker into our switch and the other end into the device we used to have it in, and right away I can see the entire site again.
My tech checks in with the customer who has been hovering over his shoulder every 10min, and the conversation goes something nlike this:
C: so did you fix it?
T: someone unplugged our equipment from your network which is why we only saw half the site.
C: must have been the last tech you sent out there.
T: actually it seems like it might have been your it guy. We havent been out here in months, and he mentioned to me last week on the phone there were up conflicts. Looks like his solution was to just unplug us from your network instead.
Tldr; 3rd party it calls us incompetent because he unplugged our equipment from their Network.

The DA would have to prove that she knowingly committed bad-faith homicide.
This is not true. 
Murder, as defined in Texas Penal Code Section 19.02, only requires:
>(1)  intentionally or knowingly causes the death of an individual;
Intentionally and knowingly are defined in Section 6.03:
>(a)  A person acts intentionally, or with intent, with respect to the nature of his conduct or to a result of his conduct when it is his conscious objective or desire to engage in the conduct or cause the result.
>(b)  A person acts knowingly, or with knowledge, with respect to the nature of his conduct or to circumstances surrounding his conduct when he is aware of the nature of his conduct or that the circumstances exist.  A person acts knowingly, or with knowledge, with respect to a result of his conduct when he is aware that his conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.
The officer intentionally pulled her weapon with the express intent on shooting Jean. Shooting someone with a firearm is *per se* deadly force in Texas. Even if the cop didn't specifically intend to kill Jean, firing her weapon is per se deadly force, and a police officer would certainly know that.
Manslaughter is defined as:
> (a)  A person commits an offense if he recklessly causes the death of an individual.
Recklessness is defined in Chapter 6 as:
>(c)  A person acts recklessly, or is reckless, with respect to circumstances surrounding his conduct or the result of his conduct when he is aware of but consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the circumstances exist or the result will occur.  The risk must be of such a nature and degree that its disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that an ordinary person would exercise under all the circumstances as viewed from the actor's standpoint.
The difference here is regarding the defendant's mental state as it pertained to the result of the conduct. Criminal "intent" requires that you intend the consequences of your actions, while recklessness does not. You could argue that here conduct constituted a "gross deviation from the standard of care", but you can also easily see how she specifically intended to shoot Jean. Recklessness generally applies when someone did not necessarily intend the consequences of their actions, but said actions were clearly reckless towards the risk of harm to human life.
Texas doesn't require any other premeditation, malice aforethought, or "bad-faith" mental state. Killing someone else is generally against the law, so if you are going to do it, you need a valid legal reason.
No one is arguing that the officer didn't intend to shoot Jean. The officer is saying that she had a valid legal reason by raising the justification of self defense (TPC Sec. 9.32) based on a mistake of fact (TPC Sec. 8.02).
Let's also be clear that the officer was arrested for manslaughter, but the Dallas DA has said that when the case goes before the grand jury, they can consider a murder charge. Whether the DA tries hard for a murder charge, whether the grand jury indicts on murder or a lesser charge, or if the defendant ultimately pleads to a lesser charge, will largely be based on compromises made by those in the system based upon the tricky facts, the tricky law, and the defendant's status as a cop. Even if the grand jury returns a murder indictment, I could easily see a plea bargain for manslaughter or negligent homicide in order to guarantee a conviction rather than run the risk of a not guilty verdict or hung jury at trial.</td><td>Failure to signal.

I agree the consultancies are a problem, but not all consultancies are the same. 
I'm over in the appsec-world. Here, working for a boutique consultancy firm is usually the desirable option. Higher pay, better work environment, and better work than being part of an internal team. Most companies don't need the specialized security experts on staff but just need them for a temporary period of time, and as one of the experts I'd rather just be focusing on one particular need rather than being an all around security guy for a company on an internal team.
Now in fairness, there definitely are the cheap labor contractors in appsec too. It's just that throwing out consultancies wholesale actually throws out many of the top jobs where h1b would make sense. 
I have to imagine there are other industries that are similar. I get where you're coming from though, perhaps also knowing the minimum cost to other companies to hire that contractor might help? Though that seems too complex.

You just dropped your envelope in there, the mail room picked it up when they collected mail every afternoon, and everything was fine.

My landlady, although very kind, is about a thousand years old. Because of that, she doesn't have a website or even a paypal account, and requires us to mail her a check for rent every month.
Enter Busybody. Busybody apparently had too much time and too little sense, and liked to harass anyone she had authority over at any opportunity. One month she saw me drop my rent check in the outgoing mail bin, and was at my desk faster than I thought a 300lb lady could even move. "The rules say the mailbox is only for work-related mail - why are you sending this letter to someone in (next suburb over)?"
"Um... Because I always do? Because I have for a year and a half now, and no one's said anything?"
So she waddled me over to her desk, where she already had the internal company website pulled up to the page on the mail room. Sure enough - no personal mail.
"Well thank you for letting me know, Busybody. Could you send me the link to this page?"
It was sitting in my inbox by the time I got back. Link to the webpage, "this constitutes a written warning," and threat of a writeup if I was caught breaking company policy again.
It was obvious what I had to do.
From then on, I watched that mailbox like a hawk. Anytime I saw a personal letter in there, I pulled it out and placed it on the sender's desk, along with a copy of Busybody's email - with her name and company email splashed across the header. In fact, I was so worried about this flagrant violation of the rules that after a couple of days I decided to start checking the mailboxes in other departments, and then on the other floors. I wouldn't want anyone else to make such an embarrassing mistake after all!
About a week later, the company's website was updated to clarify that personal mail was allowed if under blah blah size and weight.

Background: My fiancé and I lived with my parents when we had our baby. We lived with them for the first five months of baby's life before getting our own place. The only reason for this was because our baby was a surprise and we had to wait until fiancé's lease ended at his place before getting a place of our own together. My MIL was very jealous of my parents getting to see baby every day. She tried to get fiancé to live with her again and it was all very dramatic. She even tried to take my fiancé's military housing benefit to buy herself a house that we can live in with her. That was super dramatic too. Anyways, she thought she wasn't seeing our baby as often as she wanted to because of our living situation with my parents. When we moved out and the frequency of her visits remained the same, she continued to be unhappy and decided to move across the country to where her other son has just moved to because he and his wife are due to have a baby this year and she wants to be overbearing with at least one of her grandchildren. Sorry SIL, it ain't gonna be my baby, haha.
Ever since BIL moved to their new location, the talk has started about us moving there too. We've always wanted to go there but at this point in time it's not in the plan. Our baby isn't a year old yet. I've still got a few classes left before finishing my bachelors. My fiancé still has a class before finishing his associates. He has an amazing job that has already given him a raise and he's been working there for a little over a year. There is a lot of potential growth. My parents and great grandmother are here and my baby LOVES them (we obviously love them too). And our friends are here. We've started our life here and BIL and MIL are blatantly disregarding that. They won't stop pressuring us to move across the country. 
MIL went house hunting there this week. She is single. She has kept saying "when you move you can live with me" and we either shrug her off or directly say we don't want to do that. And yet, she is interested in buying a home with a 2 bedroom basement apartment so that we can live with her.
The reason this bothers me, other than disregarding our life where we live now and our direct "NO," is the money. She is a very greedy person and when it comes to money, she'll find a way to get some out of a situation if she can. So knowing her, I'm afraid she's going to buy this big house for herself, and when we don't move there with her we'll never hear the end of it. "I got this big house for you guys and you aren't even coming" or worse, she'll pull the "I am your mother and I raised you by myself and I'm still trying to help you the least you could do is help pay for this house I got for us." (That was actually a very accurate statement that could come out of her mouth, if you all knew her you would be impressed with me lol). 
Obviously we won't owe her a dime. It's just annoying that in addition to being nagged to move, we will more than likely be nagged for money too. Just today my fiancé tried to open another savings account and was denied by his bank due to a poor financial report at another institution. He has no idea what it could be. He has amazing credit and no student loans. My spidey senses are going off and saying she did something in my fiancé's name. Wouldn't be the first time. If that is the case I'm hoping that will be an example for her as to why we aren't close to her. If it were up to me, I would do a lot to cut her off financially but my fiancé is very much in the fog. He took her off his main bank account but he won't take the identity protection steps he needs to take in order to protect himself since she has his social security number and can easily do shady things.
So yeah, here's to hoping she moves away and realizes that she doesn't need all that space when it will be her living there, ALONE, she'll save herself some money, and hopefully we won't hear about it.</td><td>This is the answer. OP, your feelings are valid -- you will be alone at Christmas, possibly for the first time since you got married, and your feelings of loss over your wife's father are no doubt strong, on top of your feelings over her plans to be away -- it sounds like FIL's love of Christmas was quite infectious. But her feelings are also valid -- that was *her daddy*. It is sad that you can't go, and you've let her know your feelings on that -- including not liking her response, and again, that's all valid. In a way, I feel like her response as you have reported it here ("suck it up and be a man", it seemed) was unnecessarily harsh on her part.
However, OP, you need to stop bring your family drama to this other female friend *NOW*. You haven't slipped yet, but if this keeps up, it *will* happen -- *most likely while your wife is away for 8 days and you're pissed off about it because you've let this friend whisper in your ear*. *You* are not the asshole -- **yet** -- but your female friend *is*.
**And under no circumstances should you spend any time with her over Christmas while your wife is away!!** Alone or otherwise.
Talk to your *wife* about the "suck it up" part, but don't be angry or accusative when you do it. Also, don't try to force anything with her, because that will drive her away, and don't worry about it becoming a yearly thing until it actually does -- as the saying goes, "don't borrow trouble."
*But for the love of all that is good and holy, OP, do not discuss this any further with your female friend!* It is none of her business, and it was inappropriate for you to bring any of this to her in the first place. Sure, it seemed natural at the time -- you've been friends for a long time, and maybe you thought you would get a "female perspective" -- but this interaction is the thin end of the wedge that has every possibility of destroying your marriage. And it would be *you* destroying it, not your wife partying in the Caribbean, as you fear.
She isn't going alone, but you also don't have to be alone -- you have family as well. Spend the time with them, then be happy for her return and hope that the trip did what her family hopes it will.</td><td>0.226703888985793</td><td>0.81121568655244</td><td>8</td></tr>

Every couple of years (probably as they update algorithms), homegrown C# apps that have run for years without trouble are suddenly blocked as suspicious activity.    Usually this happens at opportune times when I have a deadline, and can plan to spend a couple of wasted hours unblocking as I did yesterday.
I would appreciate the suspicious activity protection, if the blocks were not so random, the error messages not so generic, and if the Norton interface was not so obfuscated.  
Norton 360 would be a good example of how not to build a user interface.  I can't be the only one who thinks this interface has been consistently garbage for years (but maybe I am the only one too lazy to find an alternative and move my protected systems off Norton). 
Can they please put more levels of indirection (click system tray to open one app, then another, then a sub-menu), more poor documentation, more buttons that are unclear, more sliders/security settings that do nothing I can understand.  If you can click on the suspicious activity dialog, you can click an exclude button.  Does the "Exclude Button" exclude the block on the process or exclude the application from running?  Click on the help icon and it brings up a page for which the first half of the page is how to buy add-on services.  When hunting for the right screen to access settings that matter (there is actually one buried important settings section), you can also find pages that advertise more add-on purchases.   
Disable virus/firewall for 15 min, and Norton still finds a way to flag my apps as "suspicious activity".    And when I unblock the program, and I click for example, a process that calls the database, my app closes again and the Norton "suspicious activity" dialog comes up.  I "exclude" that process, but the sqlserver or whatever process id has changed the next time I run the app - so I get another "suspicious activity" dialog.

So, I finally called Norton tech support yesterday - I wanted to see how they could fix my problem.  I watched them stumble over the same menus, get caught at the same gotchas.  For example, they wanted to add my application to trusted.  Its on the file system, not in programs directory.  You can't click the shortcut to the app, it needs the exe path.  But you can't copy the path into their dialog, you need to walk the folder tree.   The supervising tech had other trouble when this was escalated.  Ultimately, one fix that worked partially was to have norton ignore certain folders (maybe not a good security idea).  But the labeling of this functionality is counter intuitive.  On the data protector tab, you can add folders seemingly to be protected.  But despite the labels, you add folders and files that you don't want protected.  
As an aside, the norton tech support folks were nice and were trying to help.

This is the original text from the book where Desiderata was first published.
Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.
Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.
Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.
Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful.

I currently live in the south where there's not a lot of opportunity to wear boots or sweaters, so I took the opportunity to wear one of my favorite floral sweaters and knee-high heeled boots. We stopped at an Ace Hardware and, in my town's store, there's a basement section with craft supplies. I knew my stepdad would be a while, so I put in my earbuds and went downstairs to meander through that area. It's not a big store, and there was one other lady down there, so it wasn't weird that I kept seeing her out of the corner of my eye. I didn't feel like making awkward small talk or eye contact or the fake smiles you do with someone purely because they're in proximity, so I did do my best to keep my gaze in front of me and away from her as I walked through the aisles.
Cut to a few minutes later when she starts tapping me on the shoulder. I pause my music and take out one earbud and wait for her to say something. Out comes, "I've been waiting for you to help me. I've been looking for x product and can't find it anywhere!" I reply, "I'm sorry?I don't work here, I don't know what you're talking about or where you would find it..." and go to turn back around and put my earbud back in.

I see a software request for something pretty basic. Easily deployed through SCCM. I add the user to the group and give it the pre-req 20 minutes and reach out to the user
Me: Hi *user* I got your ticket to get *software* installed. If you have a moment today, open your windows menu and search for "Software Center". In there you should see the icon for *software* click on it and then click on INSTALL and it will install. If you need any help please let me know!

EU: Hi Obvious, i have looked up and down in the windows menu and i cannot find anything called the software center, please help. 
Not a problem. User is new-ish to our company and probably hasn't even seen the software center. I ping them on Lync
Me: Hi *EU* if you open your windows menu and just type in "Software" it should show up right away. 
Eu: I don't see a place to type. are you sure?
EU: Obvious, i really don't understand. there isn't a place to type. 
Eh, screw it. I walk up to the user's floor and to their desk. They see me coming and drop their head. 
EU: I swear i'm not *that* bad with computer, but typing in that menu doesn't make sense. there isn't a place to type. 
I laugh it off and take the wheel and open the windows menu and type "Software Center" and it shows up immediately.

Toyota Corolla 2013 LE. I see used engines range around $2000, but the mechanic is charging me $6000 to install a 90,000 miles used engine, or $5000 for a 120,000 miles used engine.
I'm nowhere near a car expert, and plan to look at other shops for a bit to see what they'd say. Grocery store a walk away so I'm not \*especially\* in need of it back asap (I work from home). Can afford the $6000 but it seems pretty pricey to me compared to what I've seen online.
What do you guys think? Is it a fair price for the new engine + labor? Going around to see if other mechanics can offer lower seem like the right step to take?
EDIT: Again, thanks for all the responses! Mileage on the engine was 67000, another shop I talked to said they found an engine in a junkyard that was 57000, and would buy + install it for $3800 (engine is from a Corolla that got rear ended, owner decided to leave it) w/ a 30 day warranty. MUCH better deal than $6000 for a 90000 mileage engine.

Raw data would come in at the primary site, get processed, and was returned to the end client for their use. My client didn't want to replicate the processed data, just the raw, since it could be redone at any time and was considered more critical than the final product. 
The problem was they had to use uncompressed audio files in order for the software to be able to make the best transcription, which were freaking huge in comparison to the final document files. They wanted them kept in case a transcript was wrong to compare them against.
This is probably going to give away what I was working on, but it's critical to the story. Data at site A and was snapshotted from a primary disk to a secondary, then sent over Ma Bell to site B. Once at site B, it landed on a mirror of the site A secondary disk until the packets were complete, then snapshotted to a primary disk at site B. It wasn't a single disk doing this, dozens were constantly being written to and copied over the wire to the other site all the time. This is a really simplistic way of describing it, but I'm avoiding using the exact verbiage so I don't give them away.
Anyway, I was asked to come in and implement my "product" using a new procedure that hadn't yet gotten a formal support write up yet. This was a one-off that later I found had been grudgingly given approval for and if it worked, it would be worked up into something "real." Everything was set up and when it was turned on, we were shocked at how much data was being sent over the wire and how far "out of track" it was. Data was being BLASTED down the wire, almost saturating it although the client insisted the data change rate was correctly sized for the line.
I ended up in a major northeastern city during a snowstorm so I could be at the site B datacenter to complete the switchover from catch-up to asynchronous mode. I couldn't physically get to the site because of the snow, so I hooked up my Motorola Razr to my laptop and dialed into the machine from my hotel room. I knew the data flow slacked off at 11:30p – midnight, so I sat and watched as it slowly dropped lower and lower towards the 10,000 track threshold where I could switch to async.
The window started at about 11:35 and lasted a whole 10 minutes before climbing back up. Just for giggles, I tried issuing the command anyway but it failed. So, I copied my logs and put them in an email to everyone concerned and asked, "What now?" Well, what now was the client flipping out and calling us incompetent, demanding to know why I couldn't make it happen.
I'd been putting in 12-16+ hour days on this, working overnight and weekends, traveling back and forth to site B to get it done. My boss said, "Hang on, Joe's been putting in a lot of time on this, so let's get a second opinion," and a national SME was brought in to analyze everything and do a root cause analysis. He's also a good friend too, but I knew he would tell the absolute truth in this, no matter who was to blame.
The  RCA call started out with him going over everything, explaining that he'd analyzed the nominal data traffic, adding in the new traffic, and explaining how it all worked together. His part went something like this:
"After sampling the data flow at both ends, the system, with acks is sending bidirectionally about 38.5 megabits per second, which works out to be a little over 4.8 megabytes per second, using all the capacity of the wire."
(The lightbulb was coming on in my head at this.)
"No, you have a DS3 circuit, which is 45 megaBITS. That's 5.65 megaBYTEs per second at maximum transfer rate. 0.8 megaBYTES isn't enough to allow the normal data traffic between sites without the new system. It's simply not big enough."
I never heard the man utter another word and I never heard from him again.
I'd had enough and asked my boss to move me off the project, which he gladly did. Last I heard they'd upped the bandwidth between the sites and it was working fine.
The moral of the story is, do the math, know what a bit is and know what a byte is.</td><td>That sounds like a variation of Management Stack Theory, courtesy of BOFH. The idea is that many people only have so much space in their mental process stacks, and that anything that pushes over that limit causes a stack reset, which results in an undefined mental stack state. It could be cleared out, or it could be a complete pig's breakfast of whatever was in the stack at the time of the reset, including the item that caused the reset. Simon Travaglia has a much better description of the phenomenon, plus a great working example.
You have to give those people little bits of the process at a time, because larger, more abstract statements use up much more stack and lead to sooner resets.</td><td>0.1679160370645389</td><td>0.8447490011438541</td><td>8</td></tr>

I've used the online quality of life scales, although he walks with a slight hunched back, sometimes wobbles off and sometimes it takes him a while to find a comfy way to sit down he doesn't cry, hiss, or yowl like he's in pain, he can get up and down stairs with no help, he can still jump up on my bed with no help and down again.
He has excessive thirst but eats like a horse. When I made the appointment his eating had declined but I switched him to a different wet food and he's eating as normal again.
He's never been an overly active cat, so he doesn't really play with toys that much although he still has the odd moment where he'll chase my charging leads around. We have four other cats and his behaviour towards them has not changed, he only ever gets annoyed with them if they're in his face and he certainly hasn't isolated himself away from me or others in the house. He still grooms, his fur isn't matted and the only self care he doesn't do is tending to his claws.
I'm so torn up inside, terrified that I'm doing the wrong thing and I'll have to live with that guilt of the 'buts' and 'what ifs' because when I look at him I still see my baby, just a skinnier version.
I don't even know why I'm typing this and posting, I'm not looking for medical advice but I feel I have no support and that I'm being guilt tripped into making a decision which is going to break me. If I could back out of the holiday I would but it's too late now. I'm terrified, heartbroken, confused and not sold that it's his time yet. I see his negatives and they do not outweigh his positives and it kills me that he can't tell me if he's in pain, if he's done, I just look at his face and don't see anything that triggers a response that it's time.
I'm in the U.K. and his appointment is 4pm. So seven more hours of painstaking reflection and crying.
EDIT; Spoken to the vets about a health screening before any decision is made. Also picture for added tax because he's been sunbathing this morning <URL>
UPDATED: My sweet baby tiger passed peacefully at the vets this afternoon. The vet found a mass in his lower stomach close to the base of his spine. I made the decision to put him to sleep peacefully. He died in my arms knowing he was loved. I could have took him home but with me being away for two weeks I knew I couldn't leave him knowing what the vet had said.
I'm heartbroken, I feel empty, but after knowing about the mass I wanted to give him peace after a lovely day spent together. My sister will be picking his ashes up for me while I'm away and once I'm home I can make him a memorial.

I am trying to understand VxLAN(very early days) and I haven't been able to get a 'visual picture' of how devices are connected in real-world environment.
I am hoping someone can point me to the right article, or even better, give a brief idea on how devices are actually connected.
This is the topology I am working on.
My Topology
I keep on seeing designs/intros where they say there is no leaf to leaf connectivity.
What I am trying to understand is, how do they then achieve redundancy on server?
My ESXis have 4 network ports.
For redundancy, lets say I connect 2 ports to Leaf-1 and 2 ports to Leaf-2.
Then the next step would be to create a vPC.
But how can you create vPC without connecting Leaf-1 to Leaf-2 on east-west direction?</td><td>I've had to do this at my current job and my last job.  I started out doing a CDP neighbor crawl since it's a Cisco environment, so I could find what was plugged into where (some tracing is necessary too), then as I discovered each individual connection I figured out if it was part of a LAG, and if it was L2 or L3 by running show commands.  At that point I started a Visio, I muscled through downloading model-specific stencils, and created a first diagram, then continued to refine it.  My main tips are to not use racks in your network diagrams (make that a separate one), spread out your devices into "tiers" (ie: routers up top, Core switches in the center, Distro below that, and access at the bottom), and use "non-snap connector" lines to connect your devices together, using the ellipse tool to represent LAGs.  Also, a text block with an opaque white background is very useful for putting labels/identifiers on devices and links rather then double-clicking them and adding a description on the item itself.  I found that labeling things this way makes the final diagram MUCH cleaner looking.
IMO, it's not overly useful to document individual port-to-port mappings or IP addresses in a diagram like this (like Gi0/0/0 connects to Eth1/52).  I do represent LAG numbers and dot1q tags in diagrams, but I do my physical port-to-port documentation on interface descriptions, and whether or not it is L2 or 3
`interface PortChannel10`
I personally get overwhelmed and frustrated by automated discoveries, so I always always always do manual documentation.</td><td>0.1679295981463746</td><td>0.7493667498708967</td><td>8</td></tr>

This is entirely incorrect. Most serious climate scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change (ACC) is a real thing. Where the issue lies is  is what is the effect of ACC, how serious or not is it and what, if anything should we do about it.

The compact currently has 172 electoral votes in 11 states, and more states will hold votes to join. Is this constitutional? What power do states have over their chosen electors? Several states have banded together to effectively overturn the Electoral College through passage of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.
Currently representing 172 electoral votes in 11 states and the District of Columbia, the Popular Vote Compact would de-facto turn national Presidential elections into a popular vote should states representing 270 electoral votes join.
In practice, the way this would work is your state electors would go to the winner of the national popular vote instead of your state vote.
**For example, if you live in California and a Democrat won the state popular vote 57%-43%, the Democrat would typically be given the whole 55 electoral votes California has.**
**In this new system, California would look to the winner of the national popular vote. If California still voted 57%-43% for a Democrat and the national vote was 51%-49% in favor of a Republican, the state would give their 55 votes to the Republican.**
On the mechanism (from 2nd source):
> The compact would modify the way participating states implement Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which requires each state legislature to define a method to appoint its electors to vote in the Electoral College. The Constitution does not mandate any particular legislative scheme for selecting electors, and instead vests state legislatures with the exclusive power to choose how to allocate their states' electors (although systems that violate the 14th Amendment, which mandates equal protection of law and prohibits racial discrimination, would be prohibited). States have chosen various methods of allocation over the years, with regular changes in the nation's early decades. Today, all but two states (Maine and Nebraska) award all their electoral votes to the candidate with the most votes statewide (the "winner-take-all" system).
On enactment (from the 3rd source):
> "When we hit 270, all these bills take effect simultaneously. Then there's a pool of 270 electoral votes that's going to go to whomever gets the most votes in all 50 states," Koza added.
Somewhat relevant, the United States has been willing to move towards direct elections in the past, at least in the case of Senators.
I have a couple of questions:
1: Is this constitutional? When and where will this be determined if it's not?
2: States aren't exactly getting rid of their electoral votes - they're just writing legislation that changes the prerogative of their electors.

I am reading up on some design documents in order to cater for Active/Active DCs model, which relies heavily on leaf/spine fabrics with MP-BGP EVPN as a control plane overlay (and VXLAN as data plane). The idea is to span L2 when needed, over IP fabric, without actually spanning VLANs across DCs.
There is an idea for advertising host routes (/32 and /128) into IGP and/or BGP peering with the border gateway, in order for better control of the ingress traffic. However, most guide just mentions the concept but without the actual consideration for real-world device performance.
I am thinking of a design where my border leafs at each DC would peer BGP with perimeter firewalls, since with BGP I can use lots of attributes for better control and conquer. The perimeter firewalls then can advertise summary routes if needed. IGP is giving me quite a headache in calculating costs, and there are still cases that I am concerned with asymmetric routing (since these are all stateful firewalls).

You will now have the flexibility of putting routers in front of your firewalls to handle bgp, dmvpn, sip, managed vpn router wan interfaces, and anything else that you don't necessarily want routing through your firewall.

Now your wan is down your managed vpns are down etc.  ACLs are all you'll need for those edge routers practically speaking

I am using EAP-TLS 802.1x authentication for my Teradici fleet to authenticate against the network.  My EAP cert that my RADIUS server is presenting to the clients is expiring along with the CA that signed it, so I cut a new cert / pushed the trust chain everywhere (Teradici stores, RADIUS server stores, and all other device stores).  All my other devices can authenticate with the new cert, but Teradicis are failing with "ERR\_CERT\_UNSUPPORTED\_DIGEST".  
I can confirm that I have a mutual trust - the teradicis have the entire trust chain for the new EAP cert in their local stores, and the RADIUS server also trusts the same chain.  The teradicis are actually enrolled to get client certs from the new CA as well, and that part actually works!  It's just  the new server-side cert for EAP that seems to be a problem.
When digging into the network logs for a problem Teradici, I found this:
    
I am having no luck finding what "ERR\_CERT\_UNSUPPORTED\_DIGEST" means in the context of EAP-TLS since we're authenticating based on mutual trust.  I have rolled back to my previous certificate and I am getting valid authentications again for the time being.
I think I found the cause and it SUCKS.  It appears my MS CAs were signed with the RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm, which my thins do not support.  So although I am not signing my radius server cert with that signature algorithm, since the CAs in the chain were signed with it, the Zero client cannot validate it.
Now I either have to MAB all my thin clients or recut my CA certs / reconfigure NDES and everything.  What a nightmare...
Learn from my mistakes and use SHA for your CAs, don't follow MS best practices</td><td>0.6063703372831496</td><td>0.7934700330120613</td><td>9</td></tr>

This will be my 3rd attempt at making this post to get my voice heard. Hopefully this sub will let me exercise my right of free speech. 
I feel people outside the black race think that we all think alike and share the same beliefs but this is so far from the truth. It's true that he who shouts the loudest gets the most attention and that is exactly what's happening in our country at the moment. There's millions of African Americans that share the same thoughts as me, but we get chewed out or canceled when our thoughts stray from the status quo. There's many videos of us speaking out against this, but it doesn't make the news as it goes against the narrative. 
A little About Me before I get into it:
1. I was born and raised in the "hood". Newark, NJ to be exact. I still live here, not by choice but by necessity. 
2. I AM NOT OPPRESSED!! Yes I still live in the city I grew up in, it's not the ghetto by any standard but it's not the suburbs neither. I have my own apartment, a nice car, and good credit. Am I where I want to be in life? No, not even close. But I'm working towards it. Where I'm at right now is 100% my fault and on me. I'm where I'm at in life because of my life choices. Had nothing to do with anyone else of any race, it was me. And have a plan to get where I want to be and there's no doubt in my mind that I will get there if I put in the work necessary. 
3. I've always been treated with respect by the police. To frame this I'm not just a black guy, I'm a very dark black guy. The black community comes in all shades from very fair skinned to very dark skinned. I fall into the darker category. I've gotten out of more tickets than I've received when being pulled over. I've never been to jail. One time I was put in handcuffs because I had a bench warrant because I didn't pay a tiny ticket I completely forgot about. 
These cops were respectful the entire time. They even took me to the atm so I could get myself out.. lol..it was less than $200. They saw I wasn't a threat and let me out of the handcuffs on the trip to the precinct. When we got their, the officer even apologized and said unfortunately I'd have to put the cuffs back on to walk into the precinct because it was policy. To add my license was suspended because of the unpaid ticket. But these officers drive me back to my vehicle and said "I can't advise you to drive this car, but once we leave you can do what you want". This proves treat people with respect you'll get the same back. And I was definitely far from home in a area that you'd consider predominantly "white" if that's a thing anyway. 
I understand that they may have good intentions but they are going about it the wrong way. They are trying to get demands made by force and violence. I feel as though this is not the way to get things done as it's just going to piss people off even more. Yeah you may get what you want, but it won't be out of support but it what be out of fear. Fear of being canceled, fear of not being re-elected, fear of losing your job if you speak up against them. America is built on democracy. What I am seeing right now is not a democracy but a dictatorship. If you don't agree with us then you are DONE. We're going to cancel you and burn down your business.
The rioting and looting was the dumbest thing to do and should have been condemned by BLM. People say oh the business have insurance they can rebuild. First off, how are people supposed to go grocery shopping etc. if you burned down the businesses in your neighborhood? Secondly, when things like this happen businesses don't usually come back. I'm from Newark,NJ. Back in the 60's we had similar riots that lasted for days because of a rumor that a black man was beaten by the police. You can look the story up as it's still a big event in history. But what I'm getting at is that my city is JUST NOW recovering from an event that happened over 50 years ago. These cities will never be the same, and I don't mean that in a good way. Jobs will not return and these businesses are gone forever to never return. 
I want to be accepted for who I am. Not because the government or BLM said you have to or suffer the consequences. The way they are going about this is causing a bigger racial divide more than ever and is counterproductive in what their trying to achieve. 
Dr. Martin Luther King said "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character". 
Black Lives Matter don't want that. They want special treatment for being born black. I want to get where I am because of my hard work. Not because I had to be hired to hit a "black" quota.
I'm rambling and don't want to make this too long. But I wanted to get my opinion out there because me and others like me feel our voices are being stifled. And we are afraid to speak up because any deviation of opinion will get us canceled which is not right and makes this country no longer the democracy It used to be.
TLDR: Black lives matter is going about things the wrong way to bring change. I'm black and never felt oppressed because of my race. Things will get worse if we remain on this path.
Edit: Here's Proof for those doubting my ethnicity. It's sad I even have to do this. It actually helps my point above. You can't be black if you think for yourself.
Edit 2: I am not a libertarian, conservative, or a Democrat. Im a registered independent. I just think with my mind, my Conscience, and heart. I posted here as it seems more accepting to think for myself than other places on Reddit that supposed to allow free speech.</td><td>I just gave you the definition. Absent laws or formal policies you do not have systemic racism but rather garden variety racism due to, you know, racist people.
There was a time where there was a system of oppression of black people evidenced by laws and formal policies of racist behavior. Fortunately, these racist laws and policies are a thing of the past.
If you can show me even a single example of a racist law or formal racist policy, I would be most grateful as from what I can tell, they don't exist anymore.

<tr style="background-color: green"><td>I realize now that she was manipulating this situation so that we would spend time at her house rather than my parent's house.</td><td>EDIT: I did confront her after the rent thing to let her know I thought we had agreed on just utilities, and she did back down, but it was in that moment we realized some weird dynamics were at play.</td><td>PSA: learn from me, MIL has been manipulating me for 9 years Sorry about any grammar mistakes and missing info. I have a 13month and a 1 month old, and I am quickly trying to post this during a rare moment of them both sleeping. 
I have so many stories about specific ways that MIL would try to manipulate me, but for the purpose of this post, I'm sticking to how I realized MIL has been manipulating me for 9 years.
I had no idea that my MIL has been JN all this time. MIL is the type of person that appears to be overly kind to everyone. While DH and I were dating (we started dating in the 10th grade), she would say things like: "If you ever break up, can we keep you and not him (now DH)?" or "we like you (OP) more than him (her son, Now DH). She would even refer to me as her daughter, and herself as mom ( keep in mind that we were teeenagers when we started dating). It was really important to her that I feel part of the family. DH was the first and only boy I had dated and although it felt a bit weird, she was nice, so I accepted it. Plus, I was a teenager, so my own parents and I were dealing with power struggles. 
I realize now that she was manipulating this situation so that we would spend time at her house rather than my parent's house. When MIL thought we were spending too much time with my family, she would sit her son and I down and ask, "why do you hate me?" This would result in us going over and beyond to please her so that she would know that we don't hate her and in fact, love her. She was so over the top nice, that I never realized how manipulative that question was. There were even times that I would have to leave an event with my own family, thus now offending them, to go spend time with MIL to reassure her that she was well-liked. 
She did this for years. It got worse after our first baby was born and we stopped spending the night at her house when we came into town because she had no consideration for being quiet while the baby was sleeping (we would still visit, just not spend the night there). I asked her once to please be a little quieter because it took my 3 tries to get the baby to sleep and she didn't talk to me the rest of the day. MIL scheduled a lunch with DH, drove 2 hours, took him to lunch, criticized my parenting in keeping baby on a schedule and keeping it quiet while he slept (because HER kIdS CouLd SleEp ThroUgH AnYthiNG), and then asked why we hate her. 
This was the moment I realized how manipulative MIL has been all this time. She has used being over the top kind and then playing the victim as a way to get what she wants. (This was 6 months ago)
DH told MIL that under no circumstances can she ask us that  question again, because it is manipulative and we don't hate her. Now though I am having a hard time opening up to MIL's "kindness" because I'm not sure if I am being manipulated again.</td><td>Your mom is a JN, big-time. As others in the comments have said, mom isn't a "soft place to land", she's a concrete pit with metal spikes -- *stay away*. Your husband is trying to protect his new family from one who clearly wants to cause damage to it, if not outright destruction (i.e. your mother). You and hubby are a team now -- stick together no matter what she tries to do. Your husband is revealing his shiny spine and is trying to do his job to protect you from JNMom's machinations -- put on your sunglasses and hang on, cuz it's going to be a helluva ride.
> I feel like she's saying "I know you're going to get divorced one day, but don't worry, I'll be here for you when that happens."
That's *exactly* what she's saying, and even hoping for. Worst case, *she'll try to bring that prophecy to fulfillment* through her manipulations, just to maintain her control over you. She will try to pit you against hubby; *do not fall into the trap*. You say you don't want to rock the boat. It's understandable, but you *need* to flip that boat over and *throw her out of it*. Do everything you and hubby can to get out of her house and into your own place as quickly as possible. You're freaking out and mad at hubby, even though you agree in principle with what he said.  That's what *she* wants, though -- you angry at *him* instead of *her* over what *she* did wrong. *That's the trap*. Let your anger at him subside, because he did what was necessary at the moment. Your husband is not the enemy here; he's your greatest ally. I think you know that, but years of indoctrination from the *real* enemy have you reacting knee-jerk. Suppress the brainwashing and look at it rationally.
Set those boundaries, set clear penalties, and *stick to them*. If you have trouble doing it, let your husband run interference -- it seems like he's already getting into the battle here, and I think he's up to the task. Until you're strong enough to get all the way out of the FOG, let him be the bad guy (as far as mom is concerned), but don't let him do it alone; *stick with him* -- he's going to need your support. Don't let your mom tear the two of you apart.
> EDIT: I did confront her after the rent thing to let her know I thought we had agreed on just utilities, and she did back down, but it was in that moment we realized some weird dynamics were at play.
Excellent! You stood to her up in a relatively simple matter, and *you won*. Let that build some confidence in yourself. You also begin to see how things are going to start playing out, so be prepared for bigger and harder battles. Take it one battle at a time, one day at a time, and let hubby help -- that's one of the things we husbands are there for in our marriages. Don't get complacent -- get ready for the next encounter.
I'll echo what others have already said -- get some counseling to help you clear the FOG. And above all else, *talk with your husband*. He is there for you, just as much as you are there for him. He seems to have the strength you need right now to get clear -- use it, and eventually you will have your own strength and the confidence to use it.
I know that science-fiction is not everyone's cup of tea, and especially not Star Trek. But there's an episode of Deep Space Nine that I think is worth a watch (season 6, episode 7, "You Are Cordially Invited") -- Worf and Jadzia's wedding ceremony in the last few minutes of the episode. I think it shows a picture of what you and your new husband need to be in your current situation -- a united force fighting against all who would destroy you (i.e. your mother and any flying monkeys she sends your way), watching each other's backs, and picking each other up when something knocks you or hubby down. This *will* be a battle, and you need to be ready to fight it. You have already noticed the problems, and you agree with what hubby wrote. You just need the confidence in both him and the two of you together, and the strength to break through a lifetime of mom's programming.</td><td>0.6147356924583778</td><td>0.8236053529068943</td><td>9</td></tr>

But I've run into a strange problem that I've spend several hours on and I really can't figure this one out.
I use VMWare ESXi on a Dell R820 Server for this lab. The server is connected to a regular residential ISP modem (via some cisco layer 3 witches).   I have made a quick schema (<URL>) to make my setup more clear. But it is basically Ubuntu Desktop VM -> PFSense VM -> PaloAlto VM -> ISP Modem -> internet.
The issue that I have is that the Ubuntu VM (Ubuntu01 in the schema) cannot access the internet in any way. No ping, no dns, no nothing. But the strange part is that the Ubuntu VM can ping the ISP modem (192.168.0.1), so the traffic is routed as it should through the  PFSense and PaloAlto. During my troubleshooting I tried to attach the (same) Ubuntu VM to the portgroup that connects the PFSense to the PaloAlto and from there it can access the internet just fine (Ubuntu02 in the schema).
It is just a lab, I know I don't need the PFSense and everything would work just fine if I let the Palo handle everything. But I would like to understand what is happening.

From the article "... guns are relatively benign. Most guns are never involved in a suicide or a homicide."
The key factor they point to is the presence of a depressed individual associated with gun ownership which, when you think about it, makes sense. Yeah, depressed people are more likely to use a gun to kill themselves if both: a) they are suicidal and b) there is a gun available for them to use.
Of course, the title of the article is written to influence "gun control" policy by implying that suicides would be reduced if there were fewer guns. 
The implication is that guns need to be regulated because depressed, suicidal people might use a gun to kill themselves. This simply is not good public policy because, again "Most guns are never involved in a suicide or a homicide.".
Seems to me that mental health programs with a focus on suicide prevention might be a better strategy to reduce suicides.</td><td>0.6394617324337615</td><td>0.8207465038868669</td><td>9</td></tr>

So in your case, do your PAN, PSNs, then SAN. 
Since we don't want to leave our deployment in a mismatched patch state, I prefer to start with the PAN first and bring all nodes up to the PAN level to minimize and possible issues. 
With CLI patching it's all based on how you want to do it. Want to patch all four nodes at once? Go for it. Creates a larger impact to your environment though. With fully distributed deployments, I find if faster to batch patch based on design. Meaning do your Primaries, break up your PSNs into groups and patch each group at the same time, and followed lastly by the Secondaries. Decreases total patch time and potentially reduces impact. For your case you could do your PAN, then both PSNs at the same time, then SAN. 
One other note... you should be able to prestage your upgrade by reducing the transfer time in your change window or maintenance window by using your FTP to copy the file locally ahead of time, temporarily setting up a new repo called disk, mapped to your local disk, and then calling your patch install from the disk repo during the window.

Are you serious? Just because the news doesn't cover it doesn't mean it isn't happening. There are around 1,000 shots fired incidents per year in King County, disproportionately happening in a few neighborhoods. 83% of victims are people of color and 49% are under 25.

I hope the rest of your modules aren't B rated as well. The letter isn't a subrating of the module (as I thought when I started playing) where E is the worst and A is the best. It instead reffers to sort of a type:
+ A is the most efficient
+ D is lightweight
+ E is trash
If you are going for jump range, you want your fsd A rated, and basically everything else D rated. You definitely don't want any Bs! If you are going for an exploration ship, you probably want your fuel scoop A rated as well.
There are basically two things that affect your jump range: how much fuel you can use per one jump (determined by your fsd) and how heavy your ship is. You want to get everything as light as possible. Sometimes that means leaving stuff behind, or even downsizing core modules.
Engineering your fsd is not really that hard, since the engineers that can do it are on top of the unlock tree. Gathering the required materials is also very easy.
There's another way to increase your jump range, and that is Guardian boosters. But if fsd engineering is too much for you, then that's probably out of the question.</td><td>If you are a solo slooper or even duos here are a few tips that you want engrained into you so its muscle memory.
1. As soon as you start and wake up, check the reapers board to see how many ships are flying the reapers emissary. Although it doesn't mean potential combatants, its still good to see what folks are reaping on the server. 3 or more I'd just jump to a different server. periodically check your ships map board since you can see reapers and their locations if you are running as an emissary. 
2. After you drop your anchor when you approach your destination, raise your sails then raise your anchor. Once you get better with the ships mechanics and handling, you'll be able to just raise your sails and nail your landings without touching the "brakes/anchor". Also when parking your ship on islands, choose to park it in lagoons, or on the side of the island that provides concealment, this way other ships won't see your mast if they are looking out for ships. If the island is closer to the edge of the map, park your ship on the side that's closer to the edge since less ships use those waters to travel.
3. Before you disembark, do a 360 scan of your surroundings. go up in the crows nest and see what ships are in your "area of operation". If you are going underwater for shipwrecks or lost shipments, constantly rescan your horizon whenever you come back up, a ship anchored in the middle of the open ocean is an easy target to spot.
4. If you are trying to run away, always head directly into the wind and make sure your sails are facing the wind dead on as if the wind in reality would be pushing you in reverse. Sloops can out run all other ship types when sailing into the wind with their sails in this option.
5. If you are on Xbox, or use a controller, set hot keys for your bucket, throwables, and cannon ball types. Right on the D pad for me is my bucket, Up is throwables, and Left is cannon balls. This will save you.</td><td>0.2267062158168761</td><td>0.8126095527033455</td><td>9</td></tr>

Today i bring you a short tale of my wonderful end users. 
EU: End User
I log in for my normal day and receive my normal morning tickets. Software installs, breakfix and troubleshooting. You know, typical stuff. 
I see a software request for something pretty basic. Easily deployed through SCCM. I add the user to the group and give it the pre-req 20 minutes and reach out to the user
Me: Hi *user* I got your ticket to get *software* installed. If you have a moment today, open your windows menu and search for "Software Center". In there you should see the icon for *software* click on it and then click on INSTALL and it will install. If you need any help please let me know!
About 30 minutes later I get a response:
EU: Hi Obvious, i have looked up and down in the windows menu and i cannot find anything called the software center, please help. 
Not a problem. User is new-ish to our company and probably hasn't even seen the software center. I ping them on Lync
Me: Hi *EU* if you open your windows menu and just type in "Software" it should show up right away. 
Eu: I don't see a place to type. are you sure?
EU: Obvious, i really don't understand. there isn't a place to type. 
Eh, screw it. I walk up to the user's floor and to their desk. They see me coming and drop their head. 
EU: I swear i'm not *that* bad with computer, but typing in that menu doesn't make sense. there isn't a place to type. 
I laugh it off and take the wheel and open the windows menu and type "Software Center" and it shows up immediately.
I'll spare some of the language, but the user was completely blown away by this newest revelation. They now brag to me how they impress everyone around them with their genius knowledge of Windows. 
I love my End Users.</td><td>Trust me: the internet knows your IP address. The internet *must* know your IP address, in order for it to be able to send you the data that you request when you pull up a web page or fetch your email. If the internet *didn't* know your IP address, you won't get any cat videos.
Furthermore, "your" IP address *doesn't belong to you*, plus it changes periodically. It belongs to the ISP that you get your internet service from; they just lease it out to you.
So, what you want to do is use a dynamic DNS service, or DDNS, something like No-IP or Dyn. You'll set up an account with one of those services, pick a domain name, then run a small program on your server which will update that domain name with the IP address currently assigned to your router (it's likely that your router has the capability built into it, so you wouldn't need to install anything anywhere else). Also, forward the ports in your router necessary for them to connect to your Minecraft server.
Now, you just tell your Minecraft friends to connect to your server at myminecraftserver.dynamicdnsservice.tld (don't use that, because it's fake; replace it with your actual dynamic domain name). They can technically still get your IP address, but *that doesn't matter*. And at this point, all they could do with the IP address is exactly what they can do with your DDNS domain name: connect to your Minecraft server, and maybe run a port scan, which at this point would only show the Minecraft server.
BTW, having an IP address *does not* give anyone your exact location. The *best* it can do is show that you use a specific ISP and are located somewhere within a couple hundred square miles of the address on record for that ISP's local office. And for some ISPs, they don't associate IP addresses with specific office locations, so your IP address might locate you to a spot thousands of miles away from your actual geographical location, i.e. the headquarters office of the ISP.</td><td>0.2267291873785011</td><td>0.830610585575534</td><td>9</td></tr>

So my boyfriend and I are currently living in Florida and when we leave the US (next year maybe later) we are planning to do a road trip on the west side of the country.
We have never done a road trip so we would love to have some feedback (we are enjoying the weekends at home to do some research about roadtripping): is it to short? Or do you have advices on things to not miss out? We like to hike (it will be good to walk with all the car time).
Day 1: Probably leaving Florida for either Rapid City or Denver (Denver would be because we could rent a car from Hertz and choose the SUV we want, don't think it is worth the price tho). Stopping by Target or Walmart to buy all the supplies (or been even more prepped and order everything in advance and just do a pickup). Spend the night there.
Day 2: Black Hill mountains: Stops at Mount Rushmore and Crazy Horse Memorials. Hike on Cathedral Spires trail. Go to Cody to spend the night.
Day 3 (thinking about making it a 2 days things): Go to Yellowstone. Stops at The fishing bridge museum, Chute tower, Mammoth Hot Springs, Norris Geyser Bassin museum, Canyon village, grand prismatic springs and Old faithful. Camping at west thumb.
Day 4: Go to Calter Bay village and the hidden falls in Grand Teton. Join Salt Lake City for the night.
Day 5: Go to the Arches national parc and camp there. Probably some hikes and stuffs for sun set.
Day 6: Enjoy a sun rise at the parc and comes hikes. Go to Monticello for the night.
Day 7: Ride through Monument Valley and reach the horseshoe bend.
Day 8: Anteloppe Canyon in the morning and join Zion national park.
Day 9: Visit Zion: angels landing, grafton, pipe spring monument.
Day 10: To the grand canyon: desert view watchtower, rim trail, mohave point. Sleep at Kingman.
Day 11: We got to the skywalk and then spend 1 night at Las Vegas.
Day 12: Go to Zabriskie Point, the Mesquite dunes and join Ridgecrest for the night.
Day 13: I still have to research on the trail to see the mathusalem tree
Day 14: Sequoia national park: do several trails there: the big tree, sent trail and others.
Day 15: Sequoia national park: Trail at Moro Rock and crescent meadow
Day 16: Kings Canyon: General Grant trail and other main points. Join Fresno for the night.
Day 17: Yosemite: Glacier Point and probably a trail, camping over there.
Day 18: Yosemite: Lac mirror and little Yosemite Valley. Camping again.
Days 19 - 20: Go to San Francisco and enjoy some city time.
Day 21: Drive to Fern Canyon, walk around and join Crescent City for the night.
Day 22: Walk around Samuel H Boardman State Park and drive to Crater Lake. Spend the night there.
Day 23: Enjoy a sun rise at Crater Lake, walk around. Go to the John Day Beds National Monument. Spend the night there.
Day 24: Walk around the John Day Beds National Monument. Drive to Portland.
Day 25: Go to the Columbia River Gorge Overlook.
Day 26: Leave for our home country.

<tr style="background-color: red"><td>But there is a lot of middle ground between that in a world where you talk politics with anybody you engage with from coworkers to family to friends to people you encounter throughout the day.</td><td>If the goal is some kind of equal representation on the board, 2 Democrats and 3 Republicans seems about proportional to how the county votes.</td><td>> A new Cato/YouGov poll finds that more people than ever are afraid to share their political views publicly. Majorities of Republicans, Democrats, and independents all feel this way, and the pattern persists across racial, gender, income, and educational attainment divisions.
"Back in my day" there were sayings that amounted to a common wisdom of avoiding politics at the dinner table, with a stranger and other situations where you want things to stay civil. Then, there was decline in that (perhaps correlated directly (through posts) and indirectly (through a more egocentric way of thinking) to a rise in social media). It's plausible that the renewed hesitation to put your political views out in the open is simply a correction after a relatively brief period of sharing too much.
> The poll also shows that 31% of Americans and 50% of "strong liberals" believe that a co-worker who donates money to Trump should be fired. This is not just a problem on the right, though, as 22% of Americans and 36% of "strong conservatives" believe Biden donors should be fired.
On the surface, this sounds bad and it might be bad. But it's hard to interpret without follow-up questions as to *why* they think that. Many people work at a place that necessarily has a brand and that brand necessarily is going to align with political stances (even if accidentally). Aligning your workforce to the brand it derives value from isn't quite as simple as simply firing a person because their political affiliation is intolerable. Or maybe it's a context where the perception of partisanship is important to avoid and so anybody who is or can be perceived to be strongly partisan is a liability to the company as a whole.
For example, at a fragile time in its history it hurt Firefox that Brendan Eich was promoted to CEO because he was a donor to anti-LGBT causes. (He co-founded Mozilla which led Netscape and created Firefox. He also created JavaScript, the programming language of the entire internet.) Regardless of whether you think he is entitled to have those views:
- The company may be hurt if its success is linked to the financial success of a partisan donor on a particularly divisive issue.
- Employees may be hurt if their boss passionately disagrees with something as core as their love and life partner.
- The company may be hurt by having to comment at all about either of the above which forces it to take a stance.
So, you can think that Brenden is a brilliant guy who is entitled to his views, while caring more about Mozilla's ability to remain outside of social issues or the well being of LGBT employees that are or may be under him and as a result think he is not qualified to hold that job. Do you believe that LGBT people should be equally likely to work under an openly anti-LGBT CEO? Do you believe that LGBT people should be equally likely to, among equivalent products, choose the one whose performance compensates an anti-LGBT donor? I think it's not scary or weird to expect the answers to these questions to be no. But if the answers are no, then it starts to make sense for simple business reasons (rather than personal hateful moral reasons) that people might think he deserves to be fired or not given the job. You can still disagree, but it's much much more complicated than simply firing him because you disagree with him.
> I find this trend to be troubling. Open discourse is important to a healthy democracy and society, and far too many people are afraid to participate. I used to talk politics with co-workers at lunch and learn things from them, but now I know better. I have had several co-workers admit privately that they are conservatives but don't want anyone to know. All this does is create insular bubbles where people consume only media that agrees with them and never have to have their notions challenged. In my opinion, this inevitably leads to more polarization and discord.
I think context is important to how well we can engage with people. Maybe apolitical settings like a work lunch isn't a good time. Maybe places where the person doesn't have a choice to participate in the conversation (e.g. your uber drive, the person in the grocery line) is a bad place. Maybe your mood and the amount of time you have impact it. Maybe the ability to withdraw from the person you're talking to rather than needing to see them the rest of the day and more is important to being able to receive different views. So, I think it's fine that in a lot of contexts people don't feel comfortable revealing their politics. In a way, that's a sign of a social etiquette where you care about whether a person wants to engage with emotional topics. I think due to 24-hour news and social media, people have this expectation that it should always the time to bring up emotional and divisive topics, but I think for healthy individuals and society we need to accept that wanting to confine that to a time and a place is not the same as wanting to all out ban it.
The question isn't whether people generally feel comfortable revealing their political stances. It's which places they are. If they only reveal them in subreddits named after the extreme of their political stances, they yes, that's a problem. But there is a lot of middle ground between that in a world where you talk politics with anybody you engage with from coworkers to family to friends to people you encounter throughout the day. We should have restraint and worry about revealing political views because they're necessarily emotional and important to people's lives. It makes total sense that saying something that may violate the morals or core lifestyle of the person you're talking to and then expecting them to just immediately turn that off and go back to work with you is a little unrealistic. Fearing their response can help with restraint in cases like that. But restraint and fear doesn't have to mean never do it. It just means you treat it delicately. You choose a context where you'll have time and mood to talk about it. You choose language and tone that you think the person you're talking to will be receptive to and respectful of. You recognize and plan for the emotions that may come up. And maybe even you have a plan of how you're going to reconcile yourselves after you reveal how fundamentally differently you may value things.
That is the approach I take. I am all for revealing my views and many of them are either controversial or alien to people I'm talking to. I love talking politics and can do it all day. But because of that... a *lot* of times when I *could* say something, I don't. I could be sitting in a group of friends talking about politics on a topic I care about and not say anything the whole time. It's not that I feel that I'm not allowed to talk. It's that I don't talk for the sake of having a voice and needing to be heard which I think is what a lot of people do and is what leads to problems. People talk for their own sake rather than for the listener. I talk when the context is right. Do I get the person enough to speak their language and address some of the concerns they're going to have? Do I understand their biases and how I might break the conversation out of them? Do I have time to really put things to rest or are we just going to yell conflicting views and then say bye? Is the point we agree/disagree on even going to lead to an interesting discussion or is it just a well understood, isolated subjective disagreement? Are we in a context where somebody is going to feel bullied (e.g. a group where most people are on one side)? Etc. ... In short, I think about what the person I'm talking to gets out of me talking and I think about the conversation in terms of results (even if they are just in our understanding) and that actually leads me to talk a lot less than a lot of people do but have generally good experiences even though I often talk to people who I disagree greatly with on major things.</td><td>Thanks for the summary. Also worth noting is that Spalding County is 62% white and went Trump +20 in 2020. If the goal is some kind of equal representation on the board, 2 Democrats and 3 Republicans seems about proportional to how the county votes.</td><td>0.2267704079915338</td><td>0.7700381690097312</td><td>9</td></tr>

It's the vast minority of Americans who have Silver or Gold tier plans, or, in the case of employer subsidized insurances, have picked the option which isn't the cheapest. The majority of Americans are insured with Bronze level marketplace plans, or with employer cost-containment plans. Both of these options place a heavy burden on the insured. 
From deductibles as high as 30k (seriously, just don't even bother with Blue Cross Blue Shield Bronze, it's a goddamned joke), coinsurance around 50%, and the ability to deny arguing that your hip replacement is likely due to a negligent act on your own part, I find this figure reasonable to conservative.
Regarding Medicare, the math gets hazier there, depending on which parts you've purchased, and if you've added elected a Medicare Advantage Plan as well. Depending on your choices, the Medicare fee would be in the neighborhood of 7k pretty easily.
My distaste for US health insurance and the medical profit machine was one of my motivating factors to move to Germany. When a society values corporate profits or the imagined benefits of a 3% net reduction in taxes over quality of life, I no longer want to participate in that society.</td><td>> The history of female only leagues (from chess to soccer to any other imaginable sport) has always been to give women a 'safe space to compete' because they felt they couldn't keep up in the open circuits. 
You're missing the other important factor in the US at least: Title IX. Passed in the 70s, this law requires roughly equal participation in women's sports compared to men, and is responsible for a drastic increase in scholarships and funding. Some 70,000 women each year get athletic scholarships in sports that make almost no money, largely subsidized by men's revenue sports (football and basketball). These scholarships can be life changing for these women and give huge educational opportunities. 
Protecting women's access to these programs is important, which means they need the ability to compete and win in high school.

It seems pretty straightforward, until you get to this part:
> (c) This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s. 941.28 or is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593.
So if you are under 18 and you are using a rifle or shotgun, you *need* to be in violation of 941.28, or you need to be in violation of 29.304 and 29.593 for this law to apply. You could interpret the law another way, but the Judge interpreted it this way.
941.28 has to deal with short-barrel rifles. So the defense argued, and the judge believed, that the prosecution would have needed to prove the rifle was a short-barrel rifle, which they did not.
29.304 and 29.593 deal with restrictions on hunting, and you have to be in violation of both sections. Since Kyle wasn't hunting when he violated the law, clearly this wouldn't apply to him either. Hence the dropped charges. *Edit: Other commenters have pointed out that 19.304 deals with restrictions on hunting while under the age of 16. Since Rittenhouse was 17 at the time of the shooting, it's impossible to be in violation of that one.*
TL;DR: It is legal for people under 18 to carry rifles, so long as they aren't a short-barrel rifle, and you aren't violating other hunting laws.</td><td>> Some people firmly believe that a government should always have a monopoly on violence
The venn diagram of those who want to outlaw guns and those who think "all cops are bad" is nearly a circle. Which seems completely incongruous to me.

Been a while since I last posted a story, and today, I managed to score a winner.
I am an information system security officer at an Air Force base I work at. The group I work under is responsible for writing software for numerous aircraft. We have a software "engineer" who'd been writing code for an LRU (line replaceable unit) for the F-16 platform. Apparently, after he was done writing/compiling his masterpiece, McAfee flagged his code as malware.
The code monkey decided to take this to our local McAfee team and literally demand that they whitelist his software. The McAfee team being who they are, told him that they would do no such thing until they got direction from my office. Code monkey screeches, flings feces and then makes his way to my office where upon arrival, again demands we whitelist his software.
Naturally, we tell him to go fly a kite. With McAfee flagging his pièce de résistance as malware, we kicked it over to our incident response team to assess the software for any threats in place. If they could give it a clean bill of health, then we would approve the software for whitelisting.
Code monkey, once again, screeched, flung feces everywhere and claimed that we were blocking production by going on this route. He goes on to say that this is needed next week and that it needs to be submitted for testing so that it can make production, otherwise, no F-16's will be able to fly. It's come to our attention during all of this that this code monkey thinks rather highly of himself. We also find out that the software that he's written is designed to replace the boot files on the LRUs. This makes us think that maybe this is why McAfee has flagged it as malware (because it essentially is). We explain that we're not comfortable whitelisting it just because it was developed in-house.
Code monkey storms off and leaves us laughing at the whole situation. He may not realize it, but our job is to keep our director out of jail; if your code isn't up to snuff, we're not going to allow it.
Fast Forward a day and we get an email from the McAfee team saying that the user has fixed their code. We thought that was odd, as nobody has had a chance to look at it yet. Turns out that the code monkey had one of his peers review it and found that there was a set of instructions that was directing the software to replace the boot files of the **host** system, not the LRUs they were writing for. Amazingly, once that little bit was corrected, McAfee stopped flagging his perfectly perfect line of code as malware!
TL;DR: Users bad coding was thwarted by McAfee doing its job properly for a change.</td><td>I'm thinking that Cokura was going to operate the chair alone, set it to maximum extraction, and let it burn his brain up.</td><td>0.2267998764430394</td><td>0.7690437055074009</td><td>9</td></tr>
